Every aspect of our stay was organized in advance and every question answered without asking. Highly recommended for Amsterdam city-break, if Niccolo will have us, we'll definitely stay again."
90,1628664,7/4/2012,Jac,"This was such a wonderful apartment and Niccoló was the best host! He was extremely helpful as far as giving good recommendations to great places in Amsterdam, and everything in the apartment was very clearly laid out and explained. It was as zen as described, and the rooftop terrace was such a gem.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone, and I look forward to staying again one day!"
90,5806267,7/17/2013,Benjamin,"Niccolo's beautiful apartment is ideally located -- and Niccolo is the perfect host: he went out of his way to make our stay comfortable and always replied promptly with helpful advice when we had questions. With its light and spacious interior, rooftop terrace, and incredible views of the city, Niccolo's flat is the perfect place for a relaxing, extended stay. I can't imagine a better way to experience Amsterdam!"
90,12492275,5/4/2014,Leticia,"Este apartamento é fantástico. Passei 5 dias com meu marido e filho de 2 anos e tudo foi perfeito. Nick deixou tudo em ordem, a pessoa que nos recebeu explicou todo o funcionamento da casa e o check out também ocorreu tudo certo. O terraço é um grande diferencial pois tem uma vista linda da cidade. Recomendo muito. Obrigada Nick."
90,15767404,7/15/2014,Meike,"My son and me we had a wonderful time in Amsterdam. Nicks appartment is excellent located and just amazing, wellness for eyes and soul. Communication with Nick was easy and friendly, checkin and checkout perfectly organized. Just a pity we did not meet Nick in person."
90,21149090,10/12/2014,Gal & Dudi,"Nick's place is just the place you want for your vacation! It's amazing and cozy and even bigger than it looks in the photos (!), and it's located in a great area in the lovely Jordaan, with many boutique shops, nice Cafes and beautiful streets downstairs. Before we arrived, Nick was very friendly and helped us with any question we had. He also welcomed us in his home with wine&cheese that waited for us on the table. His friend Heidi was the one who was in charge of our check-in and check-out and she was very kind and friendly too! There is a beautiful view from the roof terrace, we went up there every morning and every night to relax and breath some cool fresh air.<br/>Thank you so much Nick! We will definitely come back :)"
90,24638257,1/1/2015,Ilaria,"Nick's flat is a beautiful gem: it's cozy, super clean, with a rooftop terrace, functional kitchen and modern stylish feel. It's in the most beautiful area of Amsterdam, the Jordaan with a lots of cafè, shops and beautiful streets and canals. It's very quiet and it's a perfect place to relax. Finally it's also very easy to reach from Central Station (just 10 minutes by bus). Nick is adorable, he always replied promptly to our questions and give us good recommendations and tips to have good times in Amsterdam.<br/>It was really a pleasure to stay here and we look forward to staying again soon! "
90,34692456,6/11/2015,Clare,"Nick's flat is absolutely gorgeous - sunny and bright, with a lovely roof-top area to relax in.  After a long journey,  I instantly felt the stress melt away as I arrived, and knew that I was finally on holiday!  The flat is also in a perfect area in Amsterdam - away from the hustle and bustle of the central tourist area, but still right by the beautiful canals, bridges, lovely townhouses, boats, flowers, bicycles ... everything you expect of lovely Amsterdam.  <br/>Nick was amazingly helpful and kind, even coming back on the day I was leaving to carry my suitcase down the stairs for me.  <br/>I would totally recommend him as a host and his flat as THE place to stay for a holiday.  I had a wonderful time!"
90,38696155,7/18/2015,Erin,Our stay in Nick's apartment was absolutely perfect.  The location is ideal and within walking distance to incredible restaurants and shops.  The apartment itself is beautiful with tons of natural light.  It had everything we needed to make our own meals when we wanted to stay in.  Nick also gave us some great local recommendations for dinner and activities.  His friend Natacha was there to help us check in and out and was super helpful in leading us in the right direction.  We loved every minute of our stay in Amsterdam and would love to return!
90,51025728,10/17/2015,Wendy,Great place in a cute neighborhood! So much light; the place is very well curated. Very convenient and close to busses / tram. Host was super responsive throughout!
90,71973542,4/30/2016,Rachel,"We had a great week’s stay at Niccolo’s place, highly recommended! The apartment is beautiful (even better than the photos), very spacious and light and a great place to relax and escape form the city. The roof terrace is fantastic; unfortunately we didn’t have the weather to enjoy it more! Everything was spotlessly clean and tidy and we had everything we needed: towels, bed-linen, and well-equipped kitchen all great. <br/><br/>Location is perfect, close to everything but still peaceful. We got everywhere on bikes or on foot, just a few minutes’ walk to all great cafes and shops in the Jordaan district and easy walk to other areas of the city (Red Light/medieval centre/museums). There is a bus and a tram stop right outside the front door as well. Very quick and easy journey from the train station on the bus.<br/><br/>There are quite a few stairs up to the apartment, as mentioned in the description. These are narrow and steep by UK standards (though normal for an Amsterdam townhouse it seems). Not a problem at all for us but worth noting if any mobility problems etc.  <br/><br/>We didn’t meet Niccolo, his lovely friend met us for check-in, but all communication with him before our stay was fantastic – very friendly and quick to respond and gave us lots of great advice and recommendations.<br/><br/>Great experience - would recommend a stay here and we would definitely return if back in Amsterdam, thanks again Niccolo! <br/>"
90,89603885,7/29/2016,MarknEric,"Niccolo was a great host. Great communicator and kept his apartment clean and very comfortable.  The location was perfect as I love the Jordaan.  Nice little details around the house made it extra special.<br/>Everything was there for a comfortable stay.  I only hope that when I want to be in Amsterdam next ... it might be available !"
90,93158569,8/11/2016,Katie,"Nick was kind, prompt and informative.  He made excellent recommendations and his home is beautifully designed, conveniently located, and full of light. "
90,142706503,4/9/2017,Barbara,"Nick's spacioun, light and quiet loft apartment in the lovely Jordaan district was the perfect retreat to return to after our busy days exploring beautiful Amsterdam. We stayed for a week and were sorry to leave. The apartment is tastefully furnished, spotless and well equipped - we rustled up lovely meals  in the kitchen from  our market purchases and were able to do our laundry. The bathroom is modern <br/>and large for Amsterdam. We particularly enjoyed the scenic outlook from the windows over the roof and tree tops as well as the private large roof terrace. <br/>The apartment is situated on the border of he lovely vibrant <br/>Jordaan district right next to a bus stop and a three minute walk to the tram stop which takes you to the centre. <br/>The stairs to the apartment are good exercise but may be a challenge for the elderly. <br/>Nick was the perfect host. Communications were prompt, friendly, clear and informative. The home manual and Nick's Amsterdam recommendations were most helpful. <br/>We highly recommend Nick's place! "
90,187167828,8/26/2017,Gemma,"Nicks apartment is just amazing!! The roof terrace is one of a kind...the photos do not do any justice to the terrace or the apt! The space is very big and light and so, so peaceful. A tranquil haven, we would love to visit again. G"
90,263571568,5/12/2018,Nathalie,"Nous avons passé un merveilleux séjour .L’appartement  de Nick est très bien situé dans le quartier du Jordaan (tram et bus juste en bas , location vélo à 3 minutes à pied). Calme ,cosy, charmant ; le toit terrasse est si agréable et la vue magnifique . Nous avons été très bien accueillit par son voisin le jour de notre arrivé et Nick a veillé à notre confort en restant disponible par téléphone tout au long de notre séjour et à notre retour . Une personne de confiance qui su rendre notre voyage agréable . L’endroit idéal pour les amoureux ..d’Amsterdam . Merci !"
90,297067992,7/27/2018,Peter,"Great location, away from the unappealing tourism of a more central locations but only a 5-20 minute cycle from anywhere you'd wish to be in Amsterdam.  Felt like a residential neighborhood - UWS or parts of Brooklyn for New Yorkers, Camden or Southwark for Londoners.  Definitely rent a boat per Nick's recommendation if Spring/Summer/Fall and check out his local restaurant recommendations.  "
90,315597141,8/29/2018,Alex,"We had an amazing stay at Nick's beautiful top floor apartment. In keeping with the quintessential dutch experience, there's no elevator so be prepared to climb a few flights of steep stairs. Once in the apartment, you'll enjoy all the natural light it receives from every room. Nick's home is beautiful and is equipped with plenty of kitchen ware and several grocery stores nearby if you'd like to cook a few nights during your stay. We loved using the deck upstairs to take in the views of the city while sipping a glass of wine and snacking on charcuterie and cheese. The apartment is extremely well located with plenty of delicious places to eat within 5-10 minutes walking distance. We had an amazing stay, thank you Nick!  "
90,443482474,4/26/2019,Joan,"This apartment is in a fantastic location. It is right opposite the bus stop to central station and 10 minutes walk to the heart of Amsterdam. It is clean, spacious and warm. There is quite a climb to the top floor up a steep staircase that is very typical of Amsterdam houses. There is a lovely rooftop terrace that overlooks the city."
90,484578217,7/9/2019,Elliot,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
90,525907314,9/8/2019,Catrina,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our visit.  Nick's flat is gorgeous, and the view from the rooftop is spectacular.  Great location - right near public transport, with plenty to do within walking distance."
90,587539420,1/3/2020,Alexis,"We stayed at Nick's apartment for eight nights. The apartment was exactly as pictured and described in the listing. It was immaculate and comfortable with plenty of space for me and my husband. The kitchen was well equipped with utensils, glassware, etc., although we didn't cook because we took advantage of all the great places to eat in the neighborhood and around Amsterdam. We are not coffee drinkers and we were able to enjoy hot tea every morning thanks to the electric water kettle. The wi-fi worked well and there was a lot of natural light. We didn't spend much time on the rooftop deck because it was quite cold, but we did venture up on New Year's Eve where we could take in various fireworks displays from around the city. You can also see beautiful sunrises above the city from the bedroom window.   Nick was a good and responsive host; he communicated clearly throughout the booking process and during our stay. <br/><br/>We really appreciated the location of the apartment. It is in the northwestern part of the Jordaan neighborhood and away from the crowds. Yet you are just a ten-minute walk to pubs, restaurants, and the Saturday and Monday markets on Lindengracht, Westerstraat, and at Noorderkerk. It was about a 30-minute walk to the city center. The #3 tram and several busses stop across the street and the #5 tram stops a two-minute walk across the bridge. We took these frequently to get to the museum area and neighborhoods on the eastern side of the city."
66,1824233,7/28/2012,Damien,"!!!!What a wonderful apartment and a wonderful host!!!!! I couldn't have wished for a better experience. Wow!! the description does the place an injustice. This room is wonderfully decorated and in a wonderful location about 20mins tram ride into centrum. You are however, very close to Vondelpark and a fair few local cafes. Do not be put off by the tram ride into centraal, not only is it easy but it also gives you the sense of coming home. Did I mention the room is lovely? well it is. It has a balcony with a table and 2 chairs for you to have breakfast or just sit and read a book. Wireless Internet access is provided and works well.<br/><br/>The host is a wonderful lady who was kind enough to show us around town. If you are also lucky you may get to meet her partner who is a a charming dude :-) <br/><br/>Put simply; A wonderful room hosted by 2 wonderfully people!!"
66,1958441,8/12/2012,Caroline,"Amsterdam ist eine sehenswerte Stadt und noch besser wird sie, wenn man direkt am Vondelparkt wohnt. Das Appartment ist einfach klasse. Das Zimmer ist ausreichend groß und der Balkon ist wunderbar. Morgens beim Frühstück und Abends mit einem Glas Wein wurde der Balkon zu unserem Lieblingsplatz. Henreitte ist eine wirklich nette und sympathische Gastgeberin. Bei Fragen hilft sie, wo sie nur kann und ist auch so eine liebe Person. Das Appartment hat uns den Aufenthalt in Amsterdam ziemlich schön gemacht. Die Lage ist einfach das Beste. Nicht mitten in der Stadt aber dafür direkt am Vondelpark. Die Stadt ist super mit der Tram zu erreichen und in wenigen Minuten ist man da, wo in Amsterdam das Leben tobt. Ich und meine Freude können dieses Appartment und die Gastgeberin nur weiterempfehlen "
66,2004301,8/16/2012,Dominik,"Awesome accommodation and awesome hosts!<br/>Very nice welcome and farewell, both with a coffee for us. <br/>Henriette also gave us some books to read and some crisps and a bottle of wine.<br/>The tram takes you in about 20 minutes to the city centre.<br/>Also the price is very good for this wonderful place and those wonderful hosts!<br/>Thanks a lot Henriette & Leo!"

66,2153975,8/31/2012,Sandy,"We had a grateful stay in Amsterdam at Henriette's lovely house. The room is very clean and comfortable.  Henriette and her friend are very kind and helpful. She suggested lots of things to do in the evening that were more alternative and not so touristy. We loved this suggestions because they make our stay in Amsterdam more special. <br/>It was a perfect stay in Amsterdam. I can just recommend Henriettes room.<br/>Thank you very much Henriette and Leo.<br/>"

66,2223514,9/7/2012,Meagan,"I could not have imagined a better home or hostess. Henriette is welcoming and kind and very helpful. She was more than obliging and her hospitality was genuine. The photos do not do the place justice. The room is spacious and comfortable, more so than any hotel, and I could have stayed on that blue couch forever. There are gorgeous floor to ceiling windows that open onto a private balcony. Her neighborhood is extrememly nice and the neighbors are all families so it is very quiet at night. You are steps away from Vondelpark and the Museum and Fashion districts. Plus there is a grocery store, two bakeries, an organic grocery, and many restaurants nearby. I actually liked her neighborhood more than any other part of Amsterdam. There is a bike rental shop just around the corner and two trams that go to the Central area. You are very close to everything without being in the thick of the tourism. And again, Henriette herself and her boyfriend are wonderful and good people. Thank you Henriette!"
66,2316249,9/17/2012,Steffen,"We found a really great, peaceful place to stay with this room really close to the city! It is quite spacious, and well equiped for everything.<br/>Henriette and Leo are wonderful hosts, I loved our discussions about politics and comedy. We felt welcomed and at home from the first moment! <br/>The Vondelpark is within short walking distance as anything else one could ever need. Thanks you for the superb stay =)"
66,2336296,9/18/2012,Bruno,"Staying at Henriettes Room was one of the best decisions I made during my Eurotrip with my parents. It was much better than expected. We arrived and there were food and wine waiting for us in the cosy Room. They, Henriette und Leo, helped us a lot finding the places we would like to visit and all the things we needed. The room is really nice with bed, table, chairs, TV,coffee machine, refrigerator and all you may need to have a meal. The neighborhood is very quiet, which means that you can sleep without any problems. There is a good supermarket nearby.I strongly recommend you to stay at her place and I will definitely do it again when I go to Amsterdam"
66,2360678,9/21/2012,Imogen,"Henriette and her partner were amazing hosts, we were greeted with coffee and snacks. The room and apartment were clean and incredibly spacious, there was absolutely everything you could ask for in the room from spare chairs for the balcony, to a mini fridge in the corner of the room.

Есть полный набор посуды, холодильник, чайник, кофеварка, быстрый WI-FI. Еду мы готовили на кухне. В основном мы пользовались только микроволновой печью, разогревали готовую еду из супермаркета, это очень удобно и экономит много времени.  У нас был очень приятный контакт с хозяевами, любые вопросы решались очень быстро. Очень рекомендуем это уютное место! Очень важно жить в приятном месте в таком замечательном городе! PS/ Отдельно советуем брать велосипеды с первых дней пребывания в Амстердаме, это очень упрощает передвижение по городу, поскольку трамваи очень дорогие.<br/><br/>Very comfortable place, friendly owners!! The apartment is located near the center, 7 minutes by bike to Museumplain. We were given a large room with a nice design. The room has a comfortable bed for 2 people and additional space for a third person. There is a full set of tableware, refrigerator, coffee maker, fast WI-FI. We cook food in the kitchen. We mainly used the microwave just warmed up prepared food from a supermarket, it is very convenient and saves a lot of time. We had a very pleasant contact with the owners, any questions were solved very quickly. Highly recommend this cozy place! It is important to live in a pleasant location in a wonderful city! PS / Stand advised to take bikes from first days in Amsterdam, it's very easy travel around the city, as the trams are very expensive."
66,5085684,6/11/2013,Maxwell,"Henriette has an extremely cozy room in a beautiful apartment that is superior to any average hotel that you will find in Amsterdam for a remotely similar price. The location is right next to both a tram and busses that you take you into the more central area of the city. More importantly, it is right next to Vondelpark and close the museum area--10 minute walk. However, biking is the way to get around in Amsterdam (assuming the weather is ok) and everything (more central) is accessible by a 15-20 minute easy ride. <br/><br/>The room is awesome. It has a great touch that makes it feel like a home with the art on the walls and the other decor. The balcony is a big plus if the weather is nice. The bed (2 mattresses together in the same frame) is quite comfortable. Henriette welcomed us with wine, snacks and cookies. The room also has a coffeemaker. We were generally left alone in the house. Particularly great for a couple open to using bikes or public transport to get around. "
66,5197499,6/17/2013,Melanie,Just one word: PERFECT ! 
66,5397041,6/28/2013,Vanessa,Henriette and Leo were really friendly and gave us a lot of tipps for Amsterdam. The apartment is good situated and has such a lovely interieur! All in all it was an amazing stay (even the weather wasn't that good)
66,5488693,7/2/2013,Natalia,"Henriette and Leo were so friendly and welcoming!! Wonderful hosts. Leo came to look for us in the rain because we were lost and couldn't find the house. The room was beautiful, spacious and very comfortable. They were also very understanding when inconveniences occurred; they checked by phone if some places to eat were open, helped us with our bags (walked us to the bus station) and more. I highly recommend this lovely couple, they did everything they could and more to help us and make us feel comfortable!!  "
66,5566674,7/6/2013,Joanna And Paul,"Absolutely delightful hosts, very helpful and accommodating. The room was perfectly located a lovely 20 minute walk through Vondelpark to the Museumplatz.

The supermarkets is only 30 meters away. The room is spacious and clean, the bed is very comfortable, there is even local sweets on the table for welcoming us! Highly recommended for staying. We will definitely go back some other day! "

66,6304036,8/7/2013,Tom,"Our stay here near Vondelpark was just right! The room was comfortable with it's own refrigerator and with a nice balcony on which to sit at the end of the day or for a brief respite. There was easy access to the #2 Tram and easy walking to Vondelpark which is a beautiful park. If you are a jogger, this is a fine area to as the park is closeby. Since Henriette's home is away from the city center, it is quiet. Henriette was quite accommodating and amicable  while also respectful of our time to explore Amsterdam. She shared ideas and she left a fine tray of snack that were perfect for us at the end of the day. "
66,6365740,8/10/2013,Lara,"It was a amazing experience in Henriette´s apartment! The location is perfect, the house is lovely and clean. Herniette and Leo are great hosts and very nice persons to talk with. Highly recommended! Sorry for the delay of evaluation... "
66,6491097,8/14/2013,Meghana,"We loved our stay at Henriette's place. More so because the room was warm, spacious and comfortable with beds for 3 people to soundly sleep on. The room had a nice balcony which we hardly used though as it was too cold when we visited Amsterdam. Heriette and Leo were the nicest hosts anyone could ask for. They were sweet enough to welcome us with wine and small delicacies. They helped us out with places to visit, sights to see and maps. Really nice home and great people to stay with. I highly recommend this place to others too."
66,6617601,8/19/2013,Stefanie,"Henriette is a very friendly and warm person. She and her friend Leo made us feel very comfortable in her house and gave us great tips for our stay in Amsterdam.<br/>The house is beautiful, the room is huge and very cozy with an own balcony and lovely furnishing. The location of Henriette's house is just perfect, a few minutes to Vondelpark and beautiful places for breakfast in the neighbourhood.<br/>When we come back to Amsterdam we'll definitely stay at Henriette's again!"
66,6718613,8/22/2013,Katie,Amsterdam was a great city to visit! We felt like we knew the place by the time we left! We also took a lovely trip to the North Sea and it was spectacular!
66,6868587,8/28/2013,Jonas,"Henriette is a good hostess, welcomed us very well at your home, helped us with information and tips about Amsterdam. Recommended =D"
66,6982358,9/2/2013,Zach,"Henriette is a delight and a wealth of information on Amsterdam. The room is beautiful and well stocked, 2 minutes from a large grocery store and with a very continental balcony. Highly recommended."
66,7116450,9/7/2013,Keith,"I had a wonderful time staying with Henriette and Leo. The room, spacious, bright and airy, is located on a quiet street on which I felt very safe walking around alone at night. The hosts were incredibly kind, attentive and respectful and were very helpful with navigations and recommendations. I would stay again in a second. Thanks Henriette! "
66,7201170,9/10/2013,Bart,Zeer aangenaam ontvangst! De kamer zag er verzorgd uit en de locatie is prachtig. Om de hoek vindt je het Vondelpark en met tram 2 ben je in no time in hartje centrum. 
66,7244291,9/13/2013,Ian,Henriette and Leo are wonderful hosts.  They made us feel very welcome and showed us a side of Amsterdam that we would never have seen if we had stayed in a hotel.   We enjoyed talking to them about many things and visiting the theatre and the Melk Weg.  Highly recommended.
66,7390679,9/18/2013,Helena,"My friend Doriane and I wish to thank Henriette and Leo for all kind of useful tips they gave us during these lovely four days in the beautiful and modern City of Amsterdam. The place is very clean and is located in a very beautiful neighbourhood, near of the very best museum of the city! Thanks a lot for everything, Henriette! And a special thanks to Leo for his help with the bags!"
66,7513425,9/23/2013,Shannon,"We arrived on a rainy evening, and was warmly welcomed by Henriette and Leo. The room was a pleasant respite from the travelling. On the table, Henriette even prepared lovely stroop waffles with wine to greet us. Also, it is good to know that there is a supermarket just round the corner, and Henriette kindly permitted us to use her oven to heat up takeaways.<br/><br/>The room is exactly as shown in the pictures. It is spacious and dimly lit with a warm orange glow in the night, a perfect romantic setting. As there were three of us, we thought it might be a squeeze, but it turned out to be sufficient room, even with a small table and a sofa. The balcony was also great to use in the day although we mostly went out. <br/><br/>There are no complains, and experience was great. Thank you Henriette and Leo for being really warm hosts!"
66,7627909,9/27/2013,Claudia,"Henriette und Leo waren sehr liebenswerte Gastgeber. Meine Freundinnen und ich haben uns durch die warme und herzliche Art von Henriette rundum wohl und willkommen gefühlt. Ich hätte mir keinen besseren Aufenthalt in Amsterdam vorstellen können. <br/>Ich kann nur jedem weiterempfehlen auch ein paar Tage in diesem netten Haus zu verbringen."
66,7690868,9/30/2013,Katrien,"We had the most wonderful time here. Henriette was a very nice host, always ready to give us advice and helped us to find nice spots to go out to eat, have fun, ... We had a warm welcome here, and Leo and Henriette were very kind to help us with our bags, and there was even little welcoming present. <br/>Public transport was very easy to use, and the stop's just at the end of the street. The room is quite large, with a very comfy bed. <br/>There is a supermarket just around the corner, and the area is very safe and quiet. <br/>I would highly recommend staying with Henriette. It's been a pleasure!"
66,8247861,10/22/2013,Norman,"Everything was perfect , Room & Location was everything that I wanted. The room was lovely in a very quite street . I would not hesitate to book this room again if I come back to Amsterdam .  Henriette and Leo were very welcoming and were very courteous towards me. Excellent "
66,8525017,11/4/2013,Brooke,"We had a fantastic time staying at Henriette's apartment! There were three of us (two of us on the bed, one on an air mattress) and we all fit comfortably. Henriette and Leo took great care of us, giving us recommendations of things to do and places to go. The only downside was the location as you're situated slightly outside of the city center (though you are just an easy bike or tram ride away!)."
66,8684994,11/12/2013,Lola,Nuestra estancia en casa de Henriette y Leo fué muy agradable. Su vivienda es muy acogedora y nos encantará repetir el año que viene. Se la recomendamos a todos los que quieran disfrutar de Amsterdam en una zona muy bonita y tranquila.
66,8908952,11/25/2013,İdil,"Henriette and his partner Leo is very kind&sweet. They are very helpful. They give all the information that you need. The house is comfortable. It is 2 or 3 minutes to Vondelpark. And after walking through that amazing park, you will be in the city center ( museum area >>Museumplein ) within 10 minutes.<br/>The house and the room that you stay has a cozy style. You all have the water heater + tea&caffe'+ heineken beer+waffle offered by Henriette:) There is also a small fridge in the room.  There is a market & bakery near by the house. Take the tram number 2 or 16 for the transportation.<br/><br/>Amsterdam is amazing. The weather is cold but the people and the style of living is so hot :))) Enjoy it!!! "
66,9064139,12/3/2013,Fabienne,"Henriette & Léo sont adorables, nous avons passé un agréable week end à Amsterdam et l'accueil dans leur maison a été des plus sympathiques et chaleureux. <br/>Tout est fait pour vous rendre le séjour agréable, on a l'impression d'être un peu chez soi.<br/>La soirée (tardive) s'est terminée autour d'un verre dans leur salon comme si on se connaissaient de longue date, c'était très chouette, ça nous  fait plaisir.<br/>On reviendra."
66,9476428,12/30/2013,Laura,"I feel as if I was blessed to be able to book with Henriette! Honestly, everything was better than what I had expected. She and Leo were wonderful hosts, incredibly helpful and just very lovely people.<br/>The room was beautiful, full of light and very cosy as well. <br/>And the location was just prime - there was a grocery store just around the corner and the bus and tram stops were very near too.   "
66,9668046,1/5/2014,Genemarie,"Wonderful hospitality, beautiful room and excellent location!<br/>I would recommend Henriette's place to anyone! Easy to get everywhere and she provides lots of help resources for the traveler. Very helpful to have the refrigerator, kettle, hair dryer, and Wifi conveniences. I was there six nights and it felt like home each day as I returned from touring. Henriette and Leo are excellent hosts."
66,9921077,1/19/2014,Vijay,"Henriette was a very nice host.  She and Leo were cordial, helpful and even offered necessary guidance to spend time in Amsterdam.<br/>They kept things orderly, clean and accessible.<br/>One evening, I came back while they're having a private gathering.  They took even effort and time to offer a pleasant night with drinks.<br/>They also helped to take a print when I bought a ticket from the net.<br/><br/>Overall, I had a very comfortable and pleasant stay and recommend for people looking for stay in Amsterdam."
66,10657356,3/2/2014,Jonathan,"I can thoroughly recommend Henriette's place. It's comfortable, clean, and tastefully decorated.<br/><br/>The location is great, but then I'm biased as I live just round the corner :)<br/><br/>As she says in her review of me I was staying because my place was being renovated. Not only would I be happy to come back, but I also feel I have meet interesting friends in Henriette and Leo."
66,11083982,3/19/2014,Claudia,"Henriette's home is very nice and so cute. Henriette is so available and gentle, she give you any information about Amsterdam o other.

I love Amsterdam and I think I will come back at Henriette's room next time."
66,11153243,3/23/2014,Zsoka,"Henriette and her partner are super nice, kind and really helpfull. We enjoyed a lot being their place. Good location, very close to the tram station, supermarket at the corner, nice cafes everywhere. You can rent bikes very close to the appartement (9 EUR/24 hours) so you can feel yourself as a real Dutch. "
66,11251682,3/26/2014,Sean,"Henreitte has been the most wonderful and amazing host. I was truly moved by her kind gestures throughout my stay. <br/><br/>Her place is situated near the museum quarter with many attractions such as the Rijksmuseum, Concertgebouw, etc. It is not difficult to get around because the tram station is right at her doorstep.<br/><br/>Her place is highly recommended!! :)"
66,11365923,3/31/2014,Teresa And Ahmed,It was a very very nice stay in amsterdam and recommended in any case!!
66,12277854,4/28/2014,Ly,"Henriette et Leo sont des personnes vraiment très charmantes. Nous étions allés à Amsterdam spécialement pour la Fête du Roi. Henriette nous a très bien accueilli. C'est une personne très aimable, chaleureuse et d'une extrême gentillesse. Elle est certainement l'une des meilleures hôtes que j'ai pu rencontré. Nous nous sentions comme chez nous. Elle nous a donné pleins de bons conseils sur les lieux à visiter. Son appartement est en plus très bien localisé dans une rue très paisible. Le tram est à 2 mins de chez elle et le supermarché à 5 mins. L'entrée au Vondelpark se situe juste en face du tram. En moins de 10 mins de tram, vous êtes déjà arrivés au Museumplein, au Rijkmuseum et au Van Gogh Museum. La chambre est vraiment très spacieuse (plus qu'il n'y paraît sur les photos). On y trouve aussi un petit réfrigérateur, une bouilloire, du thé, du café, des tasses, des assiettes ainsi que tout le nécessaire pour préparer un bon petit déjeuner avant d'entamer une bonne journée de visite.

66,12428003,5/2/2014,Angela,"Our stay in Henrrite's home was very pleasant! <br/>She is highly receptive and helped us a lot.<br/>Leo was very helpfull with our big suitcases and advices.<br/>The location is very nice, beautifull in spring! easy to reach, very close to the tran stop and to the Park.<br/>This is a very good choice, I only wished we could stay longer<br/>"
66,13083526,5/19/2014,Gordan,"Henriette is a brilliant and lovely host. Talkative, open-minded and ready to give suggestions and advice about the stay in Amsterdam at any time. She knows where the happenings and festivals are throughout the city, so you can always ask her for inside information on what to do next.<br/>The room was great and in complemented our ""Amsterdam Experience"" really nicely. There is a bus stop, tram stop, Supermarket and a huge park nearby.<br/>I highly recommend her place."
66,13343549,5/26/2014,Denitsa,Henriette is great! I recommend her very highly! She shows amazing hospitality and the apartment was beyond my expectations! When I come back to Amsterdam (and that's for sure) I will stay at her house :))) 
66,13664551,6/2/2014,Andreas,"Ich war mit meinen beiden Töchtern im Teenagealter für 3 Tage bei Henriette zu Gast. Henriette ist eine sehr freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin, sehr flexibel bei der Check in und Check out zeit. Das helle und verspielt eingerichtete Zimmer bot auch für 3 Personen genug Platz. Man kann gut im Zimmer Frühstücken oder mal ein in Henriettes Küche aufgewärmte Essen einnehmen. Das bürgerliche Wohnviertel ist angenehm mit Supermarkt direkt um die Ecke. In die Innenstadt ist es aber ein etwas längerer Fußweg durch den Vondelpark oder man fährt mit der Tram. Henriette gibt gerne Veranstaltungstips, drängt sich aber nicht auf. Alles in allem eine empfehlenswerte Unterkunft, um von dort aus Amsterdam zu erkunden. "
66,13887966,6/7/2014,Maya,My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Henriette's home! The room was spacious and we had everything we could have needed. Highly recommend!

66,14354638,6/17/2014,Joan,"There were three of us and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Henriette. <br/><br/>Henriette was extremely hospitable and we felt very welcomed. She was hospitable and went beyond her means to introduce places of interest in Amsterdam that we could potentially visit. <br/><br/>The room is just as displayed in the picture and it is a really cosy room. There is even a balcony with a nice view of the street. We had three people and Henriette prepared a comfortable mattress for us.<br/><br/>The location was also very convenient as there were many bus/tram services that would bring us to wherever we wanted to go. The services were quite frequent too. We will definitely stay with Henriette if we were to visit Amsterdam again! "
66,14480929,6/20/2014,Melda,"Henriette and her boyfriend are really nice  and kind hosts, who have thought everything that you may need in Amsterdam for you in advance. They guide everything whatever you may need there. Their house is on a nice and quiet street, just away from the city center 20 mins. by tram. It is so easy to get to the city center from their house. We also rented bike upon the advice of Henriette from a shop on their street and enjoyed the city. I highly recommend her house to everyone who wants to spend some time in Amsterdam.  "
66,14735494,6/25/2014,Caterina,"The house was nice, the room cozy and clean.. Our stay was cool! It was close to Vondelpark and to a tram stop that leads to the centre.. Everything is easy to find!<br/>The only thing is that it was not allowed to use the kitchen, except for the microwave and washing your dishes (I didn'r read it), so it was disappointing to find out that we could not cook for ourselves (we are italian), because it would have been cheaper than eating always outside, and better than using always the microwave, because it is not healthy."
66,14916377,6/29/2014,Yap,"Our group of three had a wonderful stay at Henriette's place. We had to arrive just after midnight due to a cancelled flight but her partner, Leo was around to help us move in with our baggage and giving suggestions on travel. The house is large and wonderfully decorated. The room is sufficiently spacious for three and the bed is very comfortable. We also enjoyed the local snacks and wine she had prepared for us. It was a pity I only met Henriette once during our three day stay, as she goes to bed rather early. Her partner, Leo, on the other hand, usually stays up late and is very willing to help me in itinerary planning and also to talk about anything from food to politics. I highly recommend her place for an extremely comfortable stay."
66,15391341,7/8/2014,Natalia,"Останавливалась у Henriette с двумя подругами. Нам все очень понравилось. Комната чистая, уютная, тихая. В комнате есть все что нужно для комфортного пребывания. Главное есть холодильник. Нам особенно понравился балкон, на котором мы каждое утро завтракали свежими круассанами, которые покупали Broodbakker Simon Meijssen (булочная неподалеку). Буквально за углом находится чудесный супермаркет Jumbo, где можно купить все необходимое и отправится на пикник в Vondelpark, который находится в 10 минутах ходьбы от квартиры. <br/>Henriette была очень приветлива с нами, рассказала нам много полезной и интересной информации о городе. А еще к нашему приезду она подготовила вино и голландские вафли, это было очень приятно и неожиданно. <br/>"

The house is located in a charming residential área, and I´ve enjoyed very much the morning coffee at the balcony.

De kamer was erg prettig, een lekker bed, ruim voldoende kastruimte (met ruim voldoende hangertjes!) , een tv, een heerlijk espresso-automaatje, een gastvrij wijntje en knabbeltje erbij. Fantastisch dat jullie voor een geluidsapparaat gezorgd hebben, zodat ik heerlijk van mijn klassieke muziek kon genieten.<br/>Kortom, een heel fijne kamer in een prettige rustige buurt, vlakbij musea, Concertgebouw, centrum en tramverbinding met een gastvrije gastvrouw en gastheer. Een aanrader!"

The place is near de city center, with 2 direct trams to there, so is very well located. The room was exactly as the photos, very clean and confortable. Henriette prepared a welcome kit with sweets, cookies, wine and shared us plenty of tips for thing to do in Amsterdam. She's a lovely and helpfull person and, either when there's not at home she let us notes with kind information. Her's boyfriend, Leo, is very polite, calm and nice. We would recommend it to everyone!

66,21029187,10/10/2014,Jerka,"My friends and me spent 9 days at Henriette`s place and it was great. We felt very comfortable thanks to her. She welcomed us and gave us very useful tips for  a pleasent stay in Amsterdam. Everything is correct in description - two main tram roads that lead to Central station are 5 min by walk away from this flat. Even a bus from an airport stops 10 min by walk. Neighbourhood is just wonderful, green and peaceful, supermarket is just around the corner. <br/>Room is also very comfortable, you have everything you need. We saw Henriette just three times and had a little chat, but during the day we didn`t see her so we felt like we are alone in the house.<br/>All in all, we highly reccomend this wonderful room and of course, Amsterdam."

66,23450340,12/1/2014,Bart,"Gezellig plekje in een aangename en rustige buurt, niet zo ver van het culturele hart van de stad. Ideaal dus voor een romantisch weekendje met mogelijkheid tot tal van culturele uitstapjes. De beschrijving was accuraat. De ontvangst was hartelijk. Vooral de speciaal voor ons geprepareerde boekentafel en culturele tip hebben we zeer zeker geapprecieerd. Een aanrader. En een plekje om naar terug te komen."

66,30920038,4/29/2015,Nicola,"Henriette is a great host and a lovely person. She made us feel very welcome and even provided some dutch treats on arrival for us to try. She gave us excellent advice and tips on how to get around Amsterdam, things to do and the best places to eat. The room was very large and comfortable and the balcony was lovely to sit and have dinner and overlook the neighbourhood. The area itself was very quiet and peaceful, but also very easy to access the city by tram or even walking was not too far. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

Vielen Dank an Henriette und ihren Partner, wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen ;-)"
66,33217970,5/26/2015,Corinne,"Henriette et son mari nous ont accueilli avec un grand sourire et un plateau d'apéro pour nous souhaiter la bienvenue. Le logement est exactement comme sur la photo. Il ne manque rien (frigo, thé, café, nécessaire pour la vaisselle, serviette de toilette, télé, radio). Le quartier est très très bien, calme, bien fréquenté et à deux pas de Voldenpark. Le logement est très très propre. Nos hôtes sont discrets mais présents en cas de nécessité. Supérette à 100m de la maison, TRAM tout aussi proche mais on peut aller dans le centre à pied en passant par Voldenpark. Dans le quartier on trouve quelques restaurants calmes bien sympathiques où les locaux se retrouvent donc pas besoin de retourner dans le centre touristique. Pour nous l'endroit était idéal."

66,37729154,7/10/2015,Janet,"The listing was exactly as described; it was very comfortable and I had everything I needed.

66,40193116,7/29/2015,Ross,"Henriette was very good at communicating with us prior to our isit, even suggesting a major event that we might be interested in which was occurring around the time we were in Amsterdam.  Her friend Leo greeted us on arrival and carried our luggage up the steep stairs to the second floor where our lovely room was located.<br/><br/>The location of the B & B  and the room itself were perfect. We enjoyed staying in a typical traditional Dutch house and our gracious and generous host made the stay that much better. She gave us information, suggestions of things to do, directions, and a number of good things to eat and drink in the room.  "
66,40575399,8/1/2015,Rim,"Henriette und Leo waren fantastische Gastgeber. Sehr hilfsbereit  in jeder Hinsicht. Das Zimmer ist sehr gemütlich und sauber. Sie haben uns viele gute Tipps gegeben was man in Amsterdam unternehmen kann. Obwohl wir das Badezimmer und die Küche mit Ihnen teilten, hatten wir nicht einmal das Gefühl zu stören oder gestört zu werden. Man fühlt sich einfach sehr willkommen bei Ihnen. Sie sind extrem hilfsbereit und freundlich...man kann sich bei ihnen nur wohl fühlen.<br/>Ein großer Vorteil ist die Nähe zum Zentrum und die sehr guten Verbindungen mit Bus und Straßenbahn.  Wir können es nur wärmsten empfehlen....ein wunderbarer Aufenthalt, der uns in sehr guter Erinnerung bleiben wird. "
66,41063770,8/4/2015,Mélanie,Henriette et son mari sont vraiment des hôtes très charmants. Leur accueil est vraiment un plus dans le séjour. Ils sont disponibles et accueillant et ils habitent à proximité du tram pour le centre ville et du bus pour l aéroport! C était vraiment super!
66,41594318,8/8/2015,Devyani,"What do we say that has not been said before about this truly wonderful listing? Nonetheless, let me echo the gratitude I am feeling for this lovely couple.<br/><br/>The listing on the website is accurate and informative. Henriette was always very prompt and forthcoming with my numerous queries regarding the place before my booking.<br/><br/>Upon arriving a little early, Leo made sure he had the room for us at the very earliest. He was present to meet and greet us with Dutch goodies and a wealth of information. He took the effort of explaining to us the city and helped us maximise on our four day visit.<br/><br/>Every day we would be met with a warm greeting and a stimulating conversation. Henriette was kind enough to let us use the kitchen for making a snack for our 21 month old baby. She made us feel right at home, which was heartening for a toddler who just wouldn’t stop exploring the whole house! We would speak about our next day’s plans and they would give us helpful tips on making it better.<br/><br/>The room is fathfully listed, spic and span with everything in order. We enjoyed having breakfast on the balcony. It really is a charming space! <br/>The hosts were always very willing to help out, be it by lending an umbrella or by preparing a much needed pot of hot tea. Leo even ran back to his place to bring back a doll that my daughter forgot at their place after checking out! The conversations about Dutch culture, world politics have been enlightening.<br/><br/>The place is very close to the city centre, we found it very convenient to hop on to a tram and get to places in twenty minutes max. Two stops to the museums, a couple more to the city centre. Easily the place to be at, for quick travel and comfortable stay. If you find an availability on the listing (which is rare, due to its awesomeness), pounce on it!!!<br/><br/>Thank you for all your warmth, care and good will, Henriette and Leo. I could go on and on, but one gets the picture :) Hope we meet again my friends! Amsterdam was truly an enjoyable place for us and our twenty one month old daughter Anya!  <br/><br/>Cheers and good luck  XOXO"
66,42381996,8/13/2015,Felipe,"La experiencia con Henriette y Leo fue increíble! La habitación es exactamente como fue descrita y cumplieron todas las expectativas que teníamos. Fueron atentos y siempre nos dieron consejos sobre que visitar en las ciudad. Quedamos muy contentos y si decido volver a Amsterdam, no dudaré en contactarlos nuevamente."
66,45247095,9/1/2015,Erica,"Henriette and Leo were incredibly welcoming and kind, making my friends and I feel right at home.  The room description was accurate and their home is conveniently located to two tram stops for getting into the city center, a bus stop for getting to and from the Schipol airport, near Vondelpark, and near nice places to get breakfast in the morning.  The room was comfortable and very pleasant--would recommend!"
66,46123528,9/8/2015,Dorella,"Henriette e suo marito sono persone dolcissime e ci hanno accolto con   tanta disponibilità e gentilezza. La camera è esattamente come vedete nella foto. Dolcetti, salatini, caffè, bustine di thè, bollitore e macchinetta per caffè all'americana sono a disposizione. Il bagno è in comune con i proprietari, ma in realtà difficilmente li troverete negli orari del mattino e della sera, sono persone molto discrete e non invadenti. Noi non ne abbiamo fatto uso, ma volendo potete utilizzare un forno a microonde e un lavello per lavare i piatti nella loro cucina. Abbiamo avuto la bella sensazione di aver vissuto in una casa di una affettuosa famiglia olandese. "

66,47169404,9/16/2015,Edwina,"Wir haben uns bei Henriette sofort willkommen gefühlt. Alles war für uns vorbereitet und auf dem Zimmer standen sogar Snacks und Wein bereit. Die Beschreibung stimmte mit der Realität überein und Henriette hat uns noch Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt gegeben. Außerdem war sie immer für unsere Fragen offen.<br/>Die Wohnung liegt ruhig und in einer netten Nachbarschaft. Sie ist gut an den ÖPNV angebunden und in wenigen Minuten zu Fuss erreicht man den Vondelpark. <br/>Henriette und ihr Freund verhalfen uns zu einem schönen Aufenthalt in Amsterdam."
66,48041393,9/22/2015,Tamara,"It has been a very good experience to be in Henriette´s house. I didn´t know her directly but her friend, Tinka, was with us. I dont have any complaint because both, Henriette and Tinka, were so kind and attentive with us. Everything was perfectly clean and the room is quite big so, we were three people and we were comfortable. In addition to that, the room is very cosy and well decorated. the location is quite good, only 15 minutes to get to the city center by tram. "

We rented bikes for the duration of our stay as everything was accessible within a 10 minute bike ride. Thanks for the great hospitality Henriette ! "
66,50435642,10/12/2015,Pansy,"Henriette's place is absolutely adorable and cozy. She is also one of the best hosts I have had the pleasure of meeting since using Airbnb. Her hospitality really shines through as soon as you meet her and her positive demeanor is something my parents and I greatly appreciated. The room is quite spacious for two people and just a tad bit limiting for three adults. The furnishing was wonderful and my parents really loved the bed. Henriette does live in the room next door so you will have to make sure to arrange bathroom schedules. It worked out perfectly fine with us as she was very accommodating. The only small setback was the very steep stairs that lead up to the bedrooms. It might be a little difficult for some people to constantly go up and down. The location is extremely convenient as she is only a few minutes walking from two different tram stations. Her neighborhood is absolutely lovely.  All in all, it was a wonderful experience and my parents and I were so grateful for all the help and secret tidbits of Amsterdam that Henriette gave us."
66,50840469,10/15/2015,Cheryl,"Henriette and Leo are wonderful hosts. They went above and beyond to communicate with me to make my stay perfect. I LOVED their home and my room-the location is right on the tram line and just far enough out of the central city to escape the chaos but close enough to head in to all the action. It was interesting to visit with them both and hear about past and present Amsterdam, and Henriette's interests. Very very nice people. Highly recommend!!"
66,51880275,10/25/2015,Francois,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Southern Comfort! Henriette & Leo were excellent hosts and really experienced a ""home from home"" feeling while staying there. Their friendliness, assistance & guidance was brilliant and they were always willing to help with all sorts of information about Amsterdam, Holland and the Dutch culture. The accommodation is very centrally situated close to public transport, shops & restaurants and a 5 minute walk away from Vondelpark. Can definitely recommend the accommodation and will certainly visit them again in the future. Thanks Henriette & Leo for making my stay so memorable and for becoming good friends!"
66,52981309,11/3/2015,Caterina,"La nostra esperienza con Henriette è stata davvero ottima. <br/>La descrizione della casa è perfettamente corrispondente alla realtà; il quartiere è molto bello, tranquillo, vicino al centro e perfettamente collegato con le zone di maggior interesse attraverso il tram 2. La casa è molto accogliente e bella, la camera è spaziosa e luminosa: ce ne siamo innamorati appena entrati.<br/>Non abbiamo potuto conoscere personalmente Henriette perchè in quei giorni non era ad Amsterdam ma si è presa cura di noi la sua amica Tinka, una persona dolcissima della quale conserveremo sempre un ottimo ricordo. Gentile, simpatica, disponibile e mai invadente Tinka ha saputo darci ottimi consigli e farci sentire in un'atmosfera familiare. Henriette, seppure a distanza, è stata sempre presente e premurosa attraverso i suoi messaggi.<br/>Speriamo un giorno di poter tornare ad Amsterdam e poter ripetere questa fantastica esperienza. Grazie ancora ad Henriette e a Tinka!"
66,53681977,11/11/2015,Cillian Murphy,"Lovely spot with a great sized room with a balcony off, looking over a lovely street near Vondelpark. Henriette & Leo were ideal hosts, with plenty of chat & good information. Would definitely recommend a stay here!"
66,54109046,11/16/2015,Hannah,"Henriette's place was beautiful! Absolutely perfect and accurate to the pictures. The windows are gigantic and the balcony is so picturesque with a wonderful view into the street beyond. The area is rather quiet, which is actually a nice change from the center which we wouldn't have explored if we hadn't booked her place. A pretty short bike ride to wherever you have to go, and the Albert Cuyp Market close by is so convenient. "
66,54370258,11/19/2015,Meili,We have had a pleasant stay at henriette's place during our short stint in Amsterdam. Both Leo and Henriette were very helpful and gave us lots of tips to explore the beautiful city. We arrived very early in the morning during our first day in Amsterdam and they woke up early to welcome us and helped us with our luggages too. Her apartment was really pretty and well equipped with all the necessities we need. Would highly recommend her place and would definitely be back if I'm back in Amsterdam again! <br/><br/>Thanks Henriette and Leo for your warm hospitality once again! (: 
66,54862429,11/25/2015,Shyanne,Henriette was wonderful! She was available within seconds and her home was very warm and welcoming! She answers all of our questions and helped with the tram which is located very close to their home. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

66,59204048,1/8/2016,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful stay with Henriette and Leo in Amsterdam. They were very warm and friendly hosts and did their best to make us feel at home. We were given a tour and helpful information on arrival, and our hosts had been thoughtful enough to provide us with some snacks and drinks in our room. The room was clean, spacious, and well furnished, with a fridge, tea and coffee making facilities and a TV, which gave us everything and more we needed for our stay. Although we were out for the vast majority of our stay exploring the beautiful city, we knew that our attentive hosts were there if we had any questions. If we come back to Amsterdam, we would not hesitate to stay here again. Thanks to you both! "
66,60707486,1/26/2016,Juliette,"We had a very pleasant stay at Henriette's house. Henriette and Leo were welcoming and helpful. The house is very beautiful, and near the center of the city. We spent a great time in Amsterdam !<br/>Thanks for everything<br/><br/>Nous avons passé un très bon moment chez Henriette et Léo. Ce sont des hôtes très professionnels et discrets tout en étant accessibles et accueillants. "
66,61652365,2/7/2016,Manuela,Henriette was a lovely host. The girls and I enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam a lot. I would definitely recommend the comfortable and spacy room located near Vondelpark.
66,62284061,2/13/2016,Mijatovic,"The location was fantastic with the tram and buses just one minute away and supermarkets and restaurants within 5 minutes walk.<br/>The apartment was clean, had fresh linen and towels plus handwash, toiletries and well stocked kitchen with kitchen roll, sponges, washing up liquid. The apartment was light, airy, nicely decorated."
66,67820447,3/31/2016,Soulaf,"I stayed with Henriette for one month and it felt like home! She's a very welcoming host and genuinely cared for my comfort, and my own space. Her and her boyfriend were simply great! <br/>The house is beautiful and in a great location. Loved everything about it! Looking forward to my next visit already!<br/>Thank you so much Henriette!! :)"
66,68681352,4/6/2016,Eugene,"This is an awesome place to stay at if your want to enjoy what Amsterdam has to offer. The host is so friendly and makes you feel at home from the moment you arrive. The place is conveniently located to the bus/tram station and supermarket just as described. Next time I am in Amsterdam, I am definitely going to stay there.   "
66,69407835,4/11/2016,Joylee,"This is a great location in a quiet neighborhood. There is a good grocery store just a few steps from the house. You do share the main bath, but this was not a problem and there is a half bath downstairs. Typical Amsterdam staircase...a little scary. But we really enjoyed our stay and would return here. My husband enjoyed the snacks that Henriette provided. I appreciated her advise."
66,69842024,4/14/2016,Morgan,Our stay was overall good. The room was clean & looked just like the pictures. Leo - H's boyfriend was very sweet with getting us situated & Henriette emailed us some fun things to do and places to eat more like a local. However there was some construction going on outside the apartment (that we had no warning about) that was very noisy during our stay. Our favorite part however was the consistency of a nice hot shower between all three girls. We loved Amsterdam & loved the hospitality of Henriette // if we ever came back we would definitely stay there. 
66,70414665,4/17/2016,Joel,"My friends and I had a wonderful time staying here with Henriette. Henriette and Leo are great people, and it was pleasant to stay with them and chat with them. They're very friendly and welcoming, and have interesting stories and experiences to share about Amsterdam and their travels around the world. <br/>Their apartment is spacious and beautifully decorated. The 3 of us had plenty of space and had a comfortable stay. <br/>The place is nicely located near the museum district, and it is quiet and peaceful, yet just a moderate walking distance to the attractions of the city. There's also a convenient and nice supermarket around the corner. Enjoyed our stay tremendously!<br/>"
66,70878206,4/21/2016,Cam,"Nous avons passez un super séjour chez Henriette. L'accueil est chaleureux et nous avons trouvé le logement plutôt bien placé. Il y a tout ce qu'il faut dans la chambre, frigo, bouilloire, thé, café, serviettes de toilette, télé... et le quartier est vraiment agréable. "
66,71409669,4/25/2016,Lolita,"Henriette was a great host, and we had a really nice room with balcony, even though it was to cold to use it when we visited. The location was perfect with everything in walking distance. It was clean and Henriette was very helpful with tips. A local pub around the corner served great food and also we can recommend Bistro George in about 5-10 minutes walking distance. The nicest park in Amsterdam is also a few minutes away in walking distance.  So over all! Stay with Henriette! A nice quiet neighborhood - the only negative was a partying neighbor. But we didn't act - so that one is on us. "
66,72056347,4/30/2016,Mariana,"Henriette and Leo were very kind. They provided us towels, a welcome packaging with coffee, sugar, tea, wine, sweets and snacks. We could use the microwave and for six euros Henriette can wash and dry your clothes. When we arrived, Leo was waiting for us at the apartament and he gave us information about the city. The room was very comfortable and the apartament is located in a beautiful town near the most attractions of Amsterdam (you can go walking in less than 30 minutes but also can take a bus three blocks from the apartament). If I come back to this beautiful city, I will definitely go to Henriette's house."
66,72573058,5/3/2016,Andreas,Henriette was very welcoming and friendly. She also bought us a bottle of wine and some sweets. The room is very tidy and perfect for a short vacation in Amsterdam. I can totally recommand this place. 
66,72982991,5/6/2016,Otto,"Wir hatten einen angenehmen Aufenthalt in Amsterdam. Die tolle Lage bei den Museen ist ein idealer Ausgangsort für Museumsbesuche. Auch der Bahnhof und das Zentrum sind öffentlich gut mit der Straßenbahn erreichbar. Henriette und Leo standen mit vielen Tips zur Seite, wir fühlten uns sehr wohl.<br/>Wohnen im Privatquartier vermittelt das Lebensgefühl der Amsterdamer.<br/>"
66,74535960,5/15/2016,Daniel,"Henriette was super helpful and made us feel very welcome!  We were received by her friend Leo which provided all information about getting around in Amsterdam.  <br/>The place was very well located, in a silent neighborhood and close to tram lines and bus stop. We could go anywhere in a few minutes.<br/>The bedroom was super-confortable, clean and cozy. Bathroom was just outside the room. Also super clean. The description matches the actual place. There was a small fridge in which we could put our groceries bought in a supermarket very close to the place.<br/><br/>There was a small inconvenient due to noise of an unpredicted construction started at the neighbor but she let us know beforehand, provided earplugs and even contacted the neighbor. I think this show how committed she is with providing the best to her guests! <br/>Thanks a lot Henriette and Leo!!!"
66,75565678,5/22/2016,Gen,"Henriette and Leo are very warm and affectionate people and we had a lovely time at their home in Amsterdam! Leo welcomed us upon arrival, helped us with our luggage and provided us with lots of useful information about the city. Henriette also sent us a list of food recommendations, we tried a few and they were all great.<br/><br/>The house is wonderfully located at a beautiful and friendly residential area, very near to the tram stops that we used all the time to get around Amsterdam. We also recommend this amazing Thai takeaway place near the house, Busaba, which served fantastic phad thai.<br/><br/>The room was comfortable, well equipped and big. We especially loved the reclining beds and the mini eating area!<br/><br/>Thank you Henriette and Leo for your kind hospitality and for helping us so much along the way during our trip!! We will definitely return! "
66,76312410,5/26/2016,Lara,"Die Unterkunft war schön und sauber, wir wurden freundlich empfangen und die Lage ist auch echt gut. Allerdings renovieren die Nachbarn momentan, daher war es morgens etwas laut, das lässt sich in einer Stadt wahrscheinlich nicht vermeiden."
66,76803122,5/29/2016,Kornelia,Wir hatten ein schönes verlängertes Wochenende in Amsterdam und in Henriettes gemütlichem Zimmer. Henriette und Leo sind sehr freundliche Gastgeber und geben hilfreiche Tipps für die Stadterkundung. Wir haben uns Fahrräder gemietet und uns abends immer auf den Nachhauseweg durch den Vondelpark gefreut. Danach gab es noch den leckeren Wein der Gastgeber  auf dem kleinen Balkon um dann schließlich müde und glücklich ins Bett zu fallen. Danke Henriette und Leo!
66,78207125,6/5/2016,Nathalie,"Nous avons été accueilli par Léo dans ce charmant quartier très calme et pas loin du centre en tram. La chambre est grande avec un très bon lit inclinable, après une longue journée de visite cela est très appréciable. Henriette et Léo sont des hôtes charmants toujours disponible pour donner des conseils et des informations sur la ville d'Amsterdam. Nous avons passé un excellent séjour à Amsterdam et Henriette et Léo y sont pour quelque chose."
66,79638741,6/13/2016,Sue,"What a delightful stay! My husband and I had 7 nights with Henriette. Welcome wine and treats, lovely, comfortable, sunny room which is bigger than it appears in the photo. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony and watching life go by on this lovely neighbourhood street. There is building going on next door, which was no big deal, and it was always quiet in the evenings and weekends. Convenient supermarket round the corner, and we enjoyed all Henriette's local restaurant recommendations. Nearby trams and buses, but we walked everywhere and were only 15 minutes from Vondelpark or the Museumplein. Very friendly and helpful host, we really fely at home. Highly recommended."
66,81578686,6/23/2016,Giovanni,"..alle domande che si porranno i prossimi utenti interessati a pernottare ad Amsterdam e che si soffermano sull'annuncio di questo Host voglio dire che l'appartamento è proprio come lo vedete, pulito, accogliente e molto funzionale. Si vive una bella esperienza nel soggiornare qualche giorno in compagnia di Henriette e Leo. Sono stati premurosi e al tempo stesso discreti.<br/>Il quartiere è silenzioso, bello ed a pochi metri si trovano le fermate di duel linee Tram che portano in centro, nonchè la fermata del 197 (il bus Airport Express), ma anche un rifornito supermercato di quartiere. <br/>Sono soddisfatto dell'ospitalità ricevuta e della visita alla città.<br/>Grazie a Leo e Henriette"

Heel vriendelijke mensen, een gezellige lichtrijke en grote kamer, ook de badkamer is leuk. <br/>De buurt is aangenaam rustig, voor wie even uit de drukte van het centrum wil zijn. vlakbij is het Vondelpark en een paar toffe (boek)winkeltjes en restaurantjes.

The house is located in a wonderful quiet neighborhood which we had no trouble finding using Henriette's  instructions! There is a beautiful park not 10 minutes from the house and a supermarket. Most importantly there is easy and fast access to the centre of the city using the tram. The house itself is -if not better- as depicted in the photos! The room we used was cozy and spacey and provided us all comforts! Snacks,wine and fresh towels awaited  us when we arrived! The house was very clean and very comfortable and we feltat home. The two hosts were the most pleasant surprise! Both Henriette and Leo are extremely warm and friendly . Henriette provided us various info about things to do in the city and how to use local transport! They both offered their help when needed and they really seem to enjoy accommodating people!

We got all the help and information needed.  <br/>The house is very close to bus or tram station that takes you to the city center or you can simply walk. It is about 15 - 20 minutes to Rijksmuseum. The Volden park is about 5 minutes walk. <br/>There is plenty cafes, restaurants and bars around, where you can have something to eat or just chill for a while. The Anne&Mac cafe from Henriette's list of tips is a lovely place with great coffee and breakfast. Also I like the 't Blauwe Theehuis at the Vondel park. <br/>I can recommend Henriette's place to anyone who wants to spend some nice time in Amsterdam.

They help bringing our luggages up to the room on the 1st floor and help wheeling the luggages to the tram station on our last day in Amsterdam. The apartment is located within 10 mins walk from station for tram no. 2. There is another station for tram no. 6 which is possibly nearer, however the station is currently closed for few months due to road construction. The closure also impacts bus 197 from airport as the bus will skip the bus stop near the apartment, so you will need to stop at different bus stop and find the station for tram no. 2. Apartment is clean and very close to supermarket. "

66,157508190,6/4/2017,Haley,"We loved staying at Henriette's! The room is big and beautiful with a private balcony! We ended up renting bikes during our stayed and loved it, only about a 15 minute ride to the town centre, but public transportation is very close as well as many shops and places to eat. We would always find somewhere nearby to eat. Henriette and Leo give you many tips and recommendations on where to go and are always there to answer any questions! Thanks for having us!"
66,161563013,6/18/2017,Robert,"I definitely recommend Henriette’s flat. The localization is great, next to the beautiful Vondel Park with convenient connection to the city centre. The room itself was clean and nicely decorated. The climate of the flat and neighbourhood area makes you feel like you a resident of Amsterdam. Tinka (a friend of Henriette) was very nice and helpful. If I ever go back to Amsterdam I would definitely stay at Henriette."
66,163576134,6/25/2017,Rada,"Henriette's house is warm and lovely. Henriette texted us beforehand for our arrival time so check in is no problem and welcomed us with drinks and traditional dutch snacks which made the stay memorable. Please note that the stair is very steep (though it's very typical of Dutch houses). Since we have big luggage from 3-week trip, Henriette's boyfriend helped us carry the luggage up. Bless his back! The room is well equipped even though we did not make much use of it except to rest. There is a balcony to hang out and we loved it. Sharing bathroom is no problem. There's another toilet downstairs for emergency. There's a fridge in our room and Henriette let us use the kitchen - with microwave and stove so we made breakfast and dinner with stuff bought from supermarket (Jumbo) just off the block. The house is very close to tram no.2 (from Central train station and Museumplein) stop and within walking distance from Museumplein itself. Overall we loved the experience!"
66,164857002,6/29/2017,Kelsey,"Henriette and Leo were fantastic hosts! They communicated with us ahead of time, gave great advice, helped us navigate the city and were very kind. We had a fantastic time during our stay and would absolutely recommend it to anyone!"

66,183668962,8/18/2017,Sonia,"Henriette et Léo ont été adorables, très prévenants et chaleureux. Ils nous aussi donné de précieux conseils pour nos déplacements et nos visites. L appartement est très proche du centre via le tram 2, il est très agréable, la chambre en particulier, grande, lumineuse et très bien équipée. Le quartier est calme et résidentiel mais bénéficie de toutes les commodités (boulangerie, supérette, resto, laverie automatique, distributeur de billets...). <br/>Nous reviendrons avec plaisir !"
66,185367908,8/21/2017,Antonio,"Henriette and her husband Leo were really very nice and hospitable. They gave us all the guidance on how to move to Amsterdam. The house is very welcoming, clean and well connected with public transport. Very beautiful"

66,194610690,9/17/2017,Mitja,"It was the 1st time for me to use AirBnB and I can say that Henriette represents the whole spirit how this ""phenomenon"" hosting via AirBnB. She and her hausband share in stand of just a place in the house also a bit of their life. It's nice just to talk with someone who is exually liveing in the city like Amsterdam. They also give us useful tips about what to visit and how to move around. Beautiful experienc that my family and i will never forget.<br/><br/>Hope to see you in Slovenia where i would like to return you a favor for a nice experience.<br/><br/>Mitja"

66,204023713,10/16/2017,Iain,"Henriette and Leon made me very welcome, and were both friendly and charming. The house is lovely, and they took care to make sure I had what I needed. The room was really nice, comfortable and had some interesting art and a balcony looking over a nice Amsterdam street. Convenient for the Tram and for the Vondelpark and for me, the marathon weekend. I'd certainly recommend it as an enjoyable place to stay."
66,205979864,10/23/2017,Antony,"This location is amazing. It is close enough to public transit to get to central Amsterdam. If you were to walk, it would be a nice long one (definitely doable). If you were to stay in central Amsterdam, it will be quicker to get to the core, but would be a bit more noisy at night  from my experience. It is quiet and in a great neighbourhood, close to grocery, coffee shops, and other shops. Loved it!"
66,209809920,11/6/2017,Andrew,Recommend for an amazing time
66,211116052,11/12/2017,Miles,"Lovely clean room, plenty of space for three. Friendly hosts and amazing value for the location. Easy access to the centre via the tram and a very safe friendly neighborhood"

Had a very pleasant experience in Henriette’s place which is also very cosy, homely and in a great position- close to the centre in a lovely area and easy to get around with public transport."
66,219060665,12/16/2017,Pedro,"Todo muy bien en nuestra estancia con Henriette. No encontramos el lugar exacto y vinieron a buscarnos, nos explicaron los lugares mas turisticos y la casa estaba muy limpia."
66,220029531,12/20/2017,Juvena,"Henriette and Leo were really nice and welcoming. They even helped us with our luggage!! The room was sufficient for the 3 of us and it was relatively easy to find from the tram station, following Henriette's instructions from the central station!"
66,224123632,1/2/2018,Bella,"The location of this room is incredible, it’s a nice quiet area outside the main tourist buzz but a quick tram into the center. The room and bathroom was lovely and clean. The hostess was amazing, we where greeted with food and information about Amsterdam. Highly recommend !"
66,225358251,1/6/2018,苗睿,"It’s very a nice place to stay. The room is nice and the beautiful scenery out of the window. And the house is very convenient, Henriette and Leo are very kind.

66,232784988,2/6/2018,Arthur,"Great hosts, very kind and fun. Location is great and we really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam while staying at Leo and Henriette's!"
66,241188957,3/8/2018,Myrte,"Henriette ist eine sehr nette Gastgeberin. Sie hatte im Zimmer für uns Wein und ein paar Knabbersachen hingestellt. Das Zimmer selbst war wunderschön und sehr sauber. Bei der Ankunft gab Henriette uns eine Liste mit Sehenswürdigkeiten und Dingen, die man gesehen haben muss. Die Anbindung ans Zentrum ist sehr gut. Wir können das Zimmer wärmstens empfehlen und würden jederzeit wieder dort buchen"

66,245416410,3/22/2018,Clifford,"Henrietta’s home is in a perfect area for anyone wishing to explore Amsterdam. The 397 Airport Bus will take you very close to the house, buy a return ticket to use on your last day. For a three day stay we purchased a 48 hour ticket at 1pm on the first day, Monday. Using bus 16 and bus 2 from stops quite near the house the pass lasted until 1pm on the Wednesday. We then explored the Vondelpark also very near the house. We visited the Ann Franks Museum, a must see but buy tickets online before you go. Also went to the Riks Museum that is a little overwhelming full of some quite amazing art. We went early in the morning and were able to walk in without a problem. We also did a Canal Cruise something else we recommend, I wonder now if we should have chosen the hop on hop off Cruise this would allow you to explore the areas in more detail.<br/><br/>Henrietta and Leo are hosts who go that extra mile to ensure you have a great break. They will tell you about places to eat, places to go and how to make the most of your stay. The shared bathroom was not an issue at all."
66,246793869,3/26/2018,Veronica,"Un lugar muy lindo, personas encantadoras! Fácil de llegar. No duden en ir, súper recomendable. Yo volveré algún día!"
66,247899130,3/30/2018,Lena,"Unser Aufenthalt bei Henriette war super,  das Zimmer ist sehr gemütlich, es gibt alles was man braucht und mit der Straßenbahn ist man schnell im Zentrum. Die Gegend in der die Wohnung liegt ist auch sehr schön (schließt direkt ans Zentrum an, man ist keinesfalls ""außerhalb""). Henriette und Leo haben uns außerdem auch tolle Amsterdam-Tipps gegeben!"
66,249958508,4/3/2018,Gabriel,"Casa accogliente vicino alle fermate dell'autobus e del tram, collocato in una zona molto tranquilla di Amsterdam, leggermente periferica (si raggiunge il centro in 10 minuti con i mezzi pubblici). Henriette e suo marito sono molto simpatici e disponibili, ci hanno dato anche informazioni importanti sul luogo, consigliato"
66,250739718,4/6/2018,Yun Chen,"Henriette 是個非常熱情的房東,也會提供很多需要的幫助,如果你喜歡阿姆斯特丹的人文風情,這是個很好的選擇."
66,252323378,4/10/2018,Yen Nee,Henriette's house is very near to the tram towards Amsterdam central and just 2-3 stations away from Van Gogh museum and Rijksmuseum. Will definitely come back again for my next trip to Amsterdam!
66,255623715,4/21/2018,Claudia,"We had a great stay at Henriette's.  The location was perfect for us, as it was in a quiet neighborhood, and very close to Vondelpark. The room was comfortable, private, and well equipped, with a great balcony.  We really enjoyed meeting and talking with Henriette and Leo, who were generous with their time and information, and warm and friendly hosts.

66,264876195,5/15/2018,Lauro Seishi,"Local muito próximo das principais atrações turísticas. Pontos de ônibus e de bonde a apenas poucos minutos. Praticamente ao lado do Vondelpark. Transfer de ônibus do Schiphol é o melhor meio de chegar à residência. Pega-se o ônibus na saída do terminal e desembarca a poucos minutos da residência. Para quem exige silêncio é um ponto perfeito. Henriette e o seu marido são pessoas amáveis, extremamente atenciosos e prestativos. São pessoas pro-ativas no trato com os hóspedes e totalmente confiáveis. Recomendo com louvor!"
66,266047376,5/19/2018,Richard,"We loved our stay here. The apartment gave us a really cosy and pleasant feeling, and the host Henriette and her friend Leo were very friendly and welcoming, and gave us lots of advice for travelling around. The location is excellent for the museum area in particular, which was our main interest. We walked instead ofusing public transport (although the tram stop is very close by), and even with a child in a stroller we were at the Rijksmuseum in 20 minutes. We would recommend staying here, and we'd book it again if we returned to Amsterdam."
66,269407384,5/27/2018,Francesca,"Henriette’s home was a wonderfully warm space! The large room with a balcony overlooking the street was beautiful. The surprise highlight of the room was the adjustable beds! Amazing sleep every night. <br/>Henriette’s special touches included cookies, wine, and some crisps and sweets, mini fridge in the room and grocery bags for the Jumbo down the street. <br/>The location was perfect with two tram stops within 4 minutes of the home and the park right down the street. "
66,270790622,5/30/2018,Bärbel,"Henriette is a very kind hearted and interesting women.  My stay in her place was simply wonderful.  Everything was as described in the ad and even more......

66,271833024,6/2/2018,Alessandro Giacomo,"Tutto perfetto. Henriette e suo marito sono molto cordiali, discreti  e forniscono dettagli interessanti per rendere la tua permanenza ad Amsterdam ancora piu' piacevole.<br/>La posizione della casa è ottima, vicina al centro ed é ben collegata con i mezzi di trasporto pubblico.

Great value for money, would definitely recommend!! "
66,274518123,6/9/2018,Sydney,Located within 2 minutes of the closest train station that takes you directly into the city. Henriette and Leo were great hosts and very hospitable; they even greeted us with treats and wine. Great experience!

Thank you!"
66,307416269,8/14/2018,Raghav,Location was superb and the place was super clean and Henriette was very helpful during the whole process. Best stay ever will be kicked up a notch if kitchen was more accessible but not a deal breaker and it is a 5 star place
66,308919797,8/17/2018,Lauren,"This place is great! The location is awesome being so close to the amazing park(GO THERE) as well as the tram stop. We walked everywhere even into the city center which took about 40 minutes but so worth it to look at all the homes and shops on the way. Id recommend getting bikes and it would be even nicer. The house itself is beautiful, beds are comfortable, and the bathroom nice and big as well. Bathtub is a little funny; it's like a sit down shower or tub but we got used to it! I recommend this place to anyone and everyone we absolutely loved it and the hosts were so friendly and gave us the best tips and just really good conversation. Thanks so much!"
66,311982358,8/22/2018,Alessandro,"Henriette is very kind and his friend explained us everything about the house with every detail. I'm so happy to have chosen her house, despite of it's a little bit far from the city centre by feeth"

66,321861907,9/11/2018,Alejandro,"We went on a trip to Europe: Iceland, Amsterdam, Edinburgh and London.

66,425505728,3/18/2019,Cleo,"Henriette was such a fantastic host. Her house was beautiful and clean and the room we stayed in was warm, comfortable and very nicely decorated. The neighbourhood is beautiful and very close to the centre. She gave us many helpful tips about the city and very kindly left us snacks and wine upon our arrival. Thank you so much Henriette! I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here for a great time in Amsterdam."
66,429826554,3/29/2019,Suie,"We had a wonderful stay and would absolutely come back again. Leo and Henrietta were the perfect hosts. Warm, welcoming and full of knowledge. We also loved the location. It was easily accessible to everything by tram and on foot, but far enough out of the central tourist area to be peaceful and quiet at night."
66,431936291,4/2/2019,Jazmine,"I highly recommend everyone to stay here! Perfect location, the host offer great hospitality, they went above and beyond to accommodate us and made our stay even better than expected."
66,433856444,4/7/2019,Ting En,Highly recommend!!! Wonderful place.wonderful host.
66,437864892,4/15/2019,Елена,"Аутентичное местечко. Если вы любите погружаться в среду тех мест куда путешествуете - это именно то что нужно! Локация очень хорошая: в пешей доступности центр города. Транспорт рядом. Огромный зелёный парк - тоже рядом. Хозяйка гостеприимна, добра, заботлива, но общение абсолютно не навязчиво.  Дом и историей, каждый элемент интерьера с душой и смыслом, абсолютно без пафоса и напыщенности. Волшебно! Очень понравилось! Лучшие рекомендации!"
66,439002291,4/18/2019,Karine,"A really nice and quiet place, not far from the city centre. It's really easy to move around and Henriette and Leo are really helpful and caring."
66,440778585,4/21/2019,Sabina,Our stay at Henriette’s place was unforgettable experience. Everything was perfect. House was clean and we felt very comfortable there. Henriette and her friend Leo are really helpful people. We got a lot of valuable advice. Thanks to them we enjoy Amsterdam as much as possible.
66,445875282,4/30/2019,Isabelle,This is a lovely place in a great location - just south of the Vondelpark. This area is super desirable for Amsterdammers themselves and to stay here I feel is something of a privilege. The room is very comfortable with French windows opening onto a little balcony with a view of the street. Table and chairs are provided if you want to sit out. The discreet presence of Henriette and Leo means that help is usually available for any kind of tourist enquiry. The slightly bohemian style of decoration gives the house a unique feel. The bathroom is next to the room and very much appreciated. The walk into town through the park was a daily delight.
66,447190657,5/3/2019,Nicole,"Great host, enjoyed our stay. Would highly recommend!"
66,449654330,5/7/2019,Jan,It was beautiful to stay in tipical Amsterdam’s house near the city centre. Hosts were really kind and helpfull. They gave us usefull tips for trips and helped us with everything we need (printing of tickets etc.). Using of joint bathroom was without problems. We really enjoyed time in Amsterdam.
66,450800517,5/10/2019,Marielle,Beautiful place and area is so near the public transportations. Such a convienient place to be in. Great and easy location. One tram(their public transportation) takes you to most famous tourist spots in the city.
66,452561060,5/13/2019,Zlatina,"Cozy, artistic place. Quiet location, near center."
66,454368773,5/18/2019,Davide,"Soggiorno molto piacevole. La casa é esattamente come descritta nell'annuncio, molto pulita e situata in una zona molto tranquilla e  ben collegata al centro grazie ai mezzi pubblici. Henriette è stata molto cordiale e disponibile  facendoci sentire come a casa nostra, suggerendoci anche alcuni posti da vedere meno turistici. Molto consigliato"
66,458674856,5/26/2019,Sydney,"This was a very nice and clean air bnb but it is in the suburbs of Amsterdam. With it being in the suburbs, it is very quiet. The entire neighborhood is almost silent at all hours of the day and night. There are many, many children in the surrounding apartments. This makes it so that there will be noise complaints from the hosts and neighbors, if you are up just talking and laughing around 22:00. Because of the surrounding area, even though it is legal, you can NOT smoke weed on the balcony due to the smell. This was a bummer, especially being in Amsterdam, where it is legal. The apartment is clean and is in a good location. It is About a 25 minute walk into central Amsterdam through Vondelpark. VERY ENJOYABLE WALK!! The busses are also near by. You take the 2 to Central and it takes 5 minutes to walk to it. It is around the corner from a good grocery store. If you pay 8 euros the hosts do your laundry for you, but it is not open access to guests. (Make sure you give them a days notice on laundry requests) The hosts are very polite and kind. The balcony is fabulous, the bed is comfy, and everything is clean. I would recommend this Airbnb to older, more mellow couples or individuals. I would not recommend this Airbnb is you’re trying to party and go wild in Amsterdam."
66,460387417,5/29/2019,Amardeep,Good location and friendly and kind hosts

66,469133258,6/14/2019,Betanya,"Henriette was a wonderful host! She was very welcoming, friendly, and interactive with me and my friends. The room we stayed in was clean and we enjoyed the little stroopwafels and wine she left for us. We had no trouble finding her home and she gave us great tips on local areas and places to visit in Amsterdam, especially areas that weren’t as touristy. She was very knowledgeable about the area and willing to answer any of or questions. Overall I had a great experience and recommend others to stay here!"
66,475316550,6/24/2019,Darren,Great location in the center of the city and right next to a tram. The room was nice and clean and the hospitality was great. Perfect for people who like traveling around and seeing more local areas around the city.
66,476980939,6/27/2019,Anna,"The room was lovely and clean and it was great to use the balcony. It had everything we needed, and more. The area is really nice - quieter and more residential than central Amsterdam, but it's really easy to get the tram into the centre.<br/>Henriette and Leo were incredibly helpful and lovely to have a conversation with. They gave us advice on museums and transportation and even film recommendations! Leo met us on the street when we were lost, did our washing up for us when we left, and let us leave our bags in the hallway before check in and after check out times, which was a huge help.<br/>They provided plenty of snacks, cutlery and crockery for us.<br/>I would really recommend this airbnb!"

66,481110160,7/4/2019,Chris,"Super Unterkunft, sehr entspannte und ruhige Lage, aber auch eine Tram Station ums Eck und einen Park der auch nicht weit weg ist. <br/>Alles war sauber und gepflegt. <br/>Henriette hat mir auch noch eine Liste per Mail zukommen lassen, mit Tipps zum Essen gehen, feiern, etc... <br/>Kann ich nur wärmstens weiter empfehlen. :)"

66,496157011,7/27/2019,Stéphanie,"Chez Henriette et Leo, tout a été parfait ! nous avons apprécié leur accueil autour d'un petit apéro. L appartement est très bien situé près du tram 2. Leo nous a beaucoup aidé à l arrivée en nous aidant à décharger la voiture, en nous accompagnant jusqu'au parking P+R et ceci il l aurait fait même au depart à 7h du matin. Ils nous ont conseillé des lieux alternatifs sympas .. nous reviendrons sans hésiter !"

Thanks Henriette and Leo to have made this beautiful Amsterdam experience possible! :)"

66,533790943,9/22/2019,Hartmut,"Hi Leute, die Wohnung in ruhiger Lage ist einfach zu finden. Die Tram 2 fährt in der Parallelstr.  und ist in 2 Min zu erreichen. Die Linie 2 fährt mitten durch die Stadt bis zu Bahnhof. <br/>An der einen Straßenecke ist ein Supermarkt, an der anderen eine tolle Bäckerei und es gibt auch nette Kneipen für den abendlichen Absacker ganz in der Nähe.  Die Unterkunft hat einen Balkon mit Tisch und Stühlen. Heniette ist sehr hilfsbereit,  freundlich, spricht deutsch+englisch. Das Zimmer ist liebevoll eingerichtet.

64,299503965,7/31/2018,Elizabeth,"It's a beautiful light airy space which is quite large for Amsterdam. There's not much space for guests' personal items as the owner's personal items were not put up. The elevator is unreliable and broke down with a member of our party in it. We had booked it for a week and gotten a discount through Airbnb, but had to agree to pay Daniella an additional 160 euros when we picked up the key before she would agree to rent to us. I don't think we would stay here again."

64,362865386,12/27/2018,Pin-Huei,The place is near the city center and close to bus station. There is a small lift to go upstairs but still need to climb a few staircases. The respond from Daniela is quick and friendly.

Attention, à nouvel an les feux d'artifices se font partout dans la ville et par qui le souhaite. Côté ambiance c'est très sympa mais pour la sécurité attention, mon fils de 7 ans et celui de 16 ans ont reçu des projectiles au visage. Nous avons finalement regardés les multiples feux d'artifices des fenêtres de l'appartement de Daniela et c'était encore mieux."

It is easy to get in the city by bus and it was much fun to go by bike and with the ferry with Mirjam into the center of Amsterdam. To come back into this peaceful and green place  in the evening was really good and I enjoyed a lot to spend the morning on the nice balcony in the morning sun. I would definitly come back and can recommend Mirjams place to anybody. 
100,8286907,10/23/2013,Emily,"I enjoyed staying at Mirjam's.  She was a good host, her apartment was cute and very clean. She was also helpful and non-intrusive.  I'd stay again.  Thanks!"
100,12079106,4/22/2014,Nathalie,"I was very well welcomed by Mirjam. She is a very friendly person. I was looking for a safe and clean place to stay in Amsterdam with easy access to public transportation. It is exactly what her home offers. In addition of being close to the city center, you can enjoy the tranquility and greenery. Without any hesitation, I recommend Mirjam's place to everybody. "
100,12403814,5/1/2014,Gertraud,Ich hatte eine sehr schöne Zeit bei  Mirjam und ich freute mich besonders über den herzlichen Empfang!
100,15240357,7/5/2014,Heather,"Mirjam is a lovely host, I had a nice stay in her apartment. I particularly liked the cute little balcony that gives you a nice view of the trees and the bed was nice and comfortable. The apartment is located very close to a bus stop but I wouldn't suggest it for a solo traveller who plans to have a few late nights out like myself  because it takes about 30-40 minutes by bus to get to any of the popular tourist attractions and the buses don't run after midnight so I found myself spending A LOT of euros on taxis home. The wifi isn't always the best as well, cutting out occasionally. Otherwise, I had a lovely stay :) "
100,15843403,7/16/2014,Shannelle,"Mirjam's place is just heavenly. Open and lots of space (especially for Amsterdam!), with green views through every window. Minutes away from the centre, but feels miles away so truly the best of both worlds. I'd stay again in a heartbeat : )"
100,18127640,8/22/2014,Andrea,"Ich habe mich sehr wohl gefühlt. Eine schöne Umgebung. Eine wohlfühlende Unterkunft/Zimmer. Genau das richtige, wenn Frau nicht im Trubel des Stadtzentrums aufwachen möchte, welches nur 15 min. mit dem Bus entfernt ist.<br/>"
100,19346436,9/10/2014,Rachel,"I had a fantastic time here at Mirjam's. The guest room has an incredibly comfortable, warm bed with a huge window overlooking the green park outside. The room is completely silent and peaceful - perfect after a long day of sightseeing and activity. In addition, Mirjam's washroom is incredibly designed. The shower is perfectly sized with great water pressure and sensitive temperature gauge to your liking. There is also a spacious bathtub to soak your feet in to make matters even better (if possible).<br/><br/>Mirjam was helpful, hospitable, and kind in every way, from picking up groceries for my breakfast to offering me homemade pumpkin soup at night. She allowed me to use her bike during the day, and recommended local stores for my specific shopping needs. I wholeheartedly support and recommend Mirjam's accommodations to any weary traveler who is looking for a lovely new friend in a quiet Dutch flat in the beautiful Netherlands. Thank you, Mirjam - I won't forget your kindness.<br/><br/>A hug from Reykjavik,<br/>Rachel"
100,19628911,9/15/2014,Sue,"The green, quite place that Mirjam offers is everything she says and I loved my stay here.  The room is very large and bright, all the rooms very clean and the internet worked very well for my 4 days here.  I used the bus transportation from the stop immediately outside the apartment, and additionally I  had a great time biking from her house to the ferry and then around central Amsterdam.  Mirjam is a lovely, helpful, accommodating host.  While I was not at the apartment very much, I enjoyed every conversation we had and consider her my friend.  I look forward to someday returning to Amsterdam and staying with Mirjam again.  "
100,28849921,3/30/2015,Sherry,Mirjam kindly welcomed me at the bus stop when I arrived because it was midnight and raining. She made herself very accessible and she provided nice breakfast. Her apartment is not very centrally located but it doesn't take very long by bus to the centraal station. The room is big and bed is comfortable. Very enjoyable experience!
100,30104154,4/17/2015,Bianca,"Despite the fact that I arrived quite late, Mirjam met me at the bus stop and immediately made me feel very warm and welcome both in her home and in Amsterdam. This is very important for a solo female traveller! Mirjam's apartment is very serene and the location is beautiful. She provided coffee and tea and breakfast items and was very generous with this and also her time and helping me apply for jobs on Dutch websites. The location of Mirjam's apartment is a cycler's dream and I recommend borrowing her bike and cycling up to the ferries that run for free all day and night and exploring Amsterdam like a local. If you want to understand the true meaning of the Dutch word 'gezellig', you should stay in Mirjam's warm and cosy apartment, with her friendly smile!  "
100,30940580,4/29/2015,Laura,"Miriam's apartment is on the fifth floor of a building in an area with woods and meadows so the views are marvelous - you are up with the birds.  There is even a nest right outside the bedroom window, and birdsong will accompany you to the nearby bus stop.  I particularly enjoyed a Dutch breakfast on the balcony and the wide-ranging conversation we shared.  If you stay with Mirjam, you will experience a different side of Amsterdam.  Highly recommended."
100,31212383,5/3/2015,Sarah,"Amazing place, amazing person, amazing location!! I really loved my time in Amsterdam! The appartement is so great, waking up the morning to the bird singing, simply wow!

100,36993982,7/3/2015,Nadja,"Mirjam war sehr nett und ich habe mich sofort wie zuhause gefühlt. Der Check-in und Check-out verliefen ganz unkompliziert. Das Zimmer hat ein grosses Fenster, war sehr sauber und das Bett war bereits von Mirjam bezogen worden. Die Wohnung liegt zwar etwas ausserhalb des Stadtzentrums, aber mit dem Bus ist man in ca. 15 Min. mitten in Amsterdam und die Bushaltestelle ist nur 2 Min. von der Wohnung entfernt. Perfekt also für alle, die Amsterdam kennen lernen aber nachts auch ungestört schlafen möchten."

100,48930194,9/29/2015,Christine,"Mirjams Partnerin hat mich in Empfang genommen und mir das Zimmer und die anderen Räume der Wohnung gezeigt, die Schlüssel gegeben, damit ich kommen und gehen konnte, wann ich wollte.<br/>Beide waren sehr freundliche Gastgeberinnen, die immer ansprechbar waren, wenn ich Fragen hatte.<br/>Die Wohnung liegt zwar in einem Block mit insgesamt 6 Etagen, aber der Blick aus meinem Zimmer war in Bäume , die im Park stehen, also wirklich im Grünen.<br/>Nachts war es sehr ruhig,ich konnte mit dem Rad zur Fähre einen wirklich schönen Weg fahren und dank des guten Wetters hat das Ganze viel Spaß gemacht.<br/>"
100,51075821,10/17/2015,Laura,"Mirjam is a kind and interesting person, and a welcoming and informative host. I loved looking out over the green leaves below - the apartment is ideally located for tranquillity. I enjoyed the perfect slice of calm sandwiched between two hectic downtown weekends! I recommend cycling to the Cafe de Ceuvel and the NSDM for some excellent eco cuisine, cool industrial architecture and inspiring contemporary art. "

The bus is also very reliable.  Mirjam's place is quiet; you can hear the wind rustling the leaves, and the birds chirping in the back yard.  I had a lovely, peaceful stay.  Mirjam is also extremely friendly, welcoming, supportive and full of excellent suggestions-as well as endless patience if you wish to practice some Dutch!  :-D<br/>"

So the place is not in the city centre, that is, it is not close to the amsterdam central station. But there is a direct bus that connects the station to Mirjam's place. It is route 32. The bus is very convenient and takes only 15 minutes to get to the city centre. So you will not really miss out on anything. <br/>The set-up. The set-up of this airbnb is the best I have had so far. The apartment is divided into two halves by a door so one gets a lot of privacy. The refrigerator, and the shower are almost adjacent to the room.<br/>The room. The room is beautiful. It is tastefully decorated and has a great view. Mirjam has very thoughtfully arranged for a tea-kettle, tea, coffe, sugar cubes, and creamers. So one will not need to go to the kitchen for tea/coffee. It has a huge work desk, and the bed is quite comfortable.<br/>Laundry. I had been travelling for two months and I desperately needed to do laundry. Mirjam very kindly did it for me. I am so thankful to her especially for this.<br/>So if you would like to stay at a place a bit further away from the commotion of the city centre, Mirjam's place would be ideal. I would definitely like to stay here when I revisit Amsterdam."

100,205533470,10/22/2017,Andrea Sabrina,"I‘m frequently using Airbnb, usually entire appartments so this was my first try staying in a „private room“.<br/><br/>Mirjams description is accurate in terms of being a great, safe place to stay for single traveling women.<br/><br/>I Informed Mirjam in advance that I would only be in the appartment to sleep.<br/>During the checkin she informed me that she would need me being out of the appartment during a certain period of time which I found a bit misplaced (she could have told me in advance) but agreed. I then slep too long and only just made it out of the appartment on time. Her reaction made it clear that I was rather unwelcome anyways.<br/>I then moved to an other place after 2 of 4 payed nights and Mirjam seemed very happy when I left.<br/><br/>I‘m a very calm, super clean and reliable guest and think that we just didn‘t „click“ and this could have been the reason I didn‘t feel welcome at all.<br/><br/>I‘ll go for the „entire appartment“ option again the next time.<br/><br/>Besides that the bathroom was super clean, the room itself was clean too, great single bed!"
100,215019179,11/27/2017,Lara,"Mirjam was a truly wonderful host who was flexible and accommodating with my initial request as I was arriving super late.

Standing next to a park, the apartment escapes the hustle and bustle of the city, but is still conveniently located. A big grocery store and shopping malls are within walking distance (about 5-7 mins). I would definitely recommend Mirjam’s to anyone."
100,291028279,7/15/2018,Andrea,"Mirjam ist eine sehr sehr freundliche und unkomplizierte Gastgeberin. Alles hat prima geklappt. Das Zimmer ist groß und hell, und man genießt den Blick ins Grüne. Es ist sehr ruhig, so dass man nach einem langen Tag in der Stadt wunderbar entspannen kann. Dafür habe ich die gute Viertelstunde Busfahrt bis zum Zentrum gern in Kauf genommen. Sehr empfehlenswert!"
100,295379444,7/23/2018,Bérengère,"J'ai passé un excellent séjour chez Mirjam, l'appartement est très bien situé, au calme et proche du centre en transports en commun. La chambre est spacieuse et lumineuse et l'accueil de Mirjam est très chaleureux. J'y retournerai avec plaisir."

100,302906921,8/6/2018,Elsie,"Miriam’s apartment is in a quiet neighborhood, supermarkets and good restaurants are within walking distance. The near bus stop can take you to city central in about 20min. Mirjam is nice and friendly and always willing to help! She gave me good advice about my trip! <br/><br/>I came in the probably hottest time of the year so the temperature may be a little high in the room, but Mirjam prepare a little fan. She is very considerate.<br/><br/>Overall, a pleasant experience here!"
100,320644705,9/9/2018,Ruiqi,"Mirjam’s place is perfect for woman travel alone. You can live in a peace and safe community with access to everything you need. There is a shopping center very close to this apartment. Mirjam is very nice and kind, she helped me a lot during my stay here. It’s really an excellent place and I definitely recommend it."
100,324486383,9/17/2018,Liliane,"Appartement à 20mn en transport (1bus et un métro) de la gare centrale d.Amsterdam.Chambre claire avec vue superbe sur jardin<br/>Environnement calme .Centre  commercial à 5mn à pied , boutiques resto,supermarché.<br/>Possibilité de promenade nature à proximité:Lac, cours d’eau,bois<br/>Mirjam est souriante,accueillante, à l.écoute,tout en étant discrète.<br/>Séjour"
100,337101766,10/15/2018,Judith,"Mirjam is an experienced host with a fantastic place. Here location is ideal for a restful quiet sleep while being very close to services and transportation to reach the action of downtown Amsterdam. You will find a great mall only 5 minutes walk away where you can buy all you can think of from health produce to electronics and more.  Anything you may need, urgent or not, count 10 minutes by walk and it will be there for you. That gave me great peace of mind.  My bed was comfortable, the room was bright and clean and I could just be me. The divisions between the rooms made it easy to circulate with privacy between each sections of the flat and if I needed anything, Mirjam was one knock away. She has been kind and sharing, discrete and respectful. Here peaceful aura radiates from her attitude to the small details in her condo. Wonderful memories to cherish on this first trip to the Netherlands."
100,365396882,1/1/2019,Stacey,Mirjam was very kind and polite. The check-in process was super easy. The location is close enough to the city and easily accessible by metro and bus. I felt safe walking to the local store and shopping center in the area. The location is really close to everything one may need while on vacation. I recommend a little more cleaning to the bedroom and bathroom to improve the quality of your guest visit and overall atmosphere of the home.  I already discussed the specifics with Mirjam and will not go in to details here. If I had to rate her home I would give it 3 stars...comparable to a Super 8 hotel chain in the U.S. This review is not to deter anyone from staying with Mirjam. I feel it’s best to be honest so that other guest TRULY know what to expect.
100,437759422,4/15/2019,Zhiyi,The place is great! It's clean and in a nice neighborhood.

I was a bit concerned at first about the location because this place is not in the main city of Amsterdam but the public transportation was close, always on time and easy to navigate.  Mirjam was also a great and welcoming host and a fast communicator. If you are looking for a nice, quiet place to stay in Amsterdam this is the place."

You can find all you need there. It's very clean, tidy. The furniture isn't old. Another exceptional part was communication. Merijn wasn't currently in Amsterdam but he answered quickly to all the questions, gave us very clear explanations and made sure that everything was okay. And his friend met us, showed the apartment and left us lots of wonderful tips, maps and advices. House is really not far from the city centre. We rented bikes and it was at about 15 minutes of light ride to get to central part of the city. <br/>So, we really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam and we highly recommend this place to stay"

The apartment was fantastic in itself and in a good location. An easy less than 20 minutes bus ride to Centraal. It was super clean and tidy and had everything you need. And it was beautifully decorated and furnished. Merijn was a brilliant host, he even came out to meet me to give me the keys during his lunch break and show me around and answer any questions I had while I was there and via sms's afterwards. He even had hand written instructions with maps and Amsterdam tourist brochures on his bed with clean towels. I would definitely stay there again next time I am in Amsterdam. "

We stayed for 2 nights and had a great time. Sonja and Merijn were always quick in replying to messages and answering questions. Check-in was no problem at all (thanks again for being so flexible!) and Sonja had even prepared some lemon water in the fridge for us. It's easy to get into town via bus, but we've had such nice weather that we walked most of the time (there's a lovely park very close to the apartment). Just one very minor thing: it was a bit noisy at night (until around 2 am), maybe due to some neighbours partying? But other than that we would always stay here again!"

44,12947061,5/15/2014,Chi Ying,"First of all, Wilbert is a very nice guy.   Although we landed at Amsterdam at early morning, much earlier than the check-in time, Wilbert woke up especially early to welcome us and let us to keep our bags at his own apartment.  Again, on the day we left, he also let us to store the bags at his place after the check-out time until our departure.  When we had questions, he answered immediately via mail or mobile.  He gave us many tips about the neighbourhood.  Besides, he showed us his very impressive collections of own-built striking mechanism.  Just like a friend showing his treasure.<br/><br/>About the apartment, it is very clean and tidy.  (oh, the bed is extremely comfortable and shower is prefectly powerful :-) nothing is more important than that, or?)  The kitchen is fully set and clean.  It locates just only half hour from airport and 15 minutes walking distance to the most famous museums.  The neigbhood is as well very friendly and safe, many cosy cafes and resturants around the corner.<br/><br/>Thanks a lot for the warm hospitality and I truly recommand people to stay at Wilbert´s Vondel House."
44,13134420,5/20/2014,Karina,"Wilbert's home is a lovely and comfortable place. The bathroom is very clean and beautiful. The apartment is well equiped with refrigerator, oven, TV and all you need.

44,13664134,6/2/2014,Rory,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Vondel house!  A nice peaceful location in a beautiful neighborhood.  Its just down the street from a major tram line and walking distance to the center of the city, if so inclined.  Wilbert was an excellent host, who was kind enough to print out some tickets for us and answer any questions we had.  Shayna and Bruce were also extremely nice.  Definitely a recommended place to stay for those looking to be close to the noise and chaos of center city but prefer not to be sleeping in it.  "
44,13885914,6/7/2014,Lee,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay here. Located in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood, the apartment was easily accessible by tram from both the main Amsterdam train station and downtown. The room itself was comfortable; the private shower was particularly nice. I had no problems at all with others staying in the house. I'd highly recommend this room to anyone visiting Amsterdam."
44,14080960,6/11/2014,Emek,"I stayed at Vondel House, Guest Room 2 for 3 nights. All my time there was perfect... The room and the apt are in very good condition with brand new bath and toilet. The neighbourhood was also perfect me as I always like to stay at the neighbouroods where locals live. If you want to be close enough to all attraction points and far enough from the hassle of those touristic areas, you should stay at this apt.<br/><br/>Wilbert, the host, was also very kind and easygoing people... He loves his rooms and apt and keeps them in very good condition. I am pretty sure that, next time I will be stay there again."
44,14187295,6/14/2014,Linda,Adorable flat. Access to the main living and kitchen area was a bonus. Our own cupboard and refrigerator was appreciated. Lovely bed and shower accommodations. Spacious and open with a fabulous view. We loved being so close to...everything. Wilbert recommended Vondelpark and after a day in city center this was a piece of heaven. We are happy to recommend Wilbert's place. 
44,15184003,7/4/2014,Rachel,"This is a great apartment to stay in. It's in a great location, right next to a huge beautiful park, with public transport that will take you downtown right around the corner. The room itself is very spacious and clean, it even has it's own shower! There is a friendly kitty that wanders the house, which is a nice little bonus. Wilbert was extremely helpful and very friendly. He was prompt and helpful with his communication. Definitely worth staying here!"
44,15446225,7/9/2014,Guilherme,"Wilbert was a lovely host. He took the time to walk us through everything and made sure we were comfortable. He even printed a ticket for us. The aparment was amazing and very conveniently located. You can rent good bikes for cheap just around the corner. With them, getting around Amsterdam is not only easy, it's awesome. Comfortable bed and amazing shower. Shayna, who also lives there, was also receptive. The cat, Bruce, was unbelievably friendly and hurried into our room every night to greet us and play! All in all, one of the best stays in the entire trip."
44,15586037,7/12/2014,Raheem,"We love, love, love the Vondel House! <br/><br/>It was our first stop on our honeymoon Europe tour and it really set the tone for our trip. Wilbert was very accommodating and quick to help. We had a minor medical emergency and he went out if his way to help us: calling doctors and giving us information. <br/><br/>The room is beautiful and just like the photos. Shayna was nice and helpful. Bruce the cat really enjoys company, and he would hang out with us in our room each night. She's super sweet. Be prepared to walk four flights of stairs! (But I think this is true most places in Amsterdam.) The shower and toilet are beautifully designed.<br/><br/>Really lovely...we'll definitely be back.<br/><br/>Saafir and Aston<br/>"
44,15911179,7/18/2014,Jack And Jill," Wilbert graciously offered to pick me up at the airport upon arrival. His place, Guest Room 1 where I stayed, was quite lovely. A bit tough getting up and down the stairs with all the luggage, but we managed. Aside from that, the room was very spacious and cozy. The living room and kitchen are shared. You're allotted your own cupboard with dishes, etc, and space on the fridge. There's a room manual on the desk in your room full of information: what's around the neighborhood, house rules, check out checklist, etc. This was helpful. Guest Rooms 1 & 2 share a toilet. Didn't have soap in there so I used my own with the sink in my room. Shayna was very nice and helpful as well. Great location. Not too busy. Close to public transportation - ie., the trams. Great food nearby (try Saafron) and a supermarket (Albert Heijn). Also very near to the park. Great place for running if you're into that!"

Unser  Zimmer war sehr sauber und gut eingerichtet, Toilette und Dusche in ausgesprochen schönem Design. Die Wohnküche war sehr gemütlich und gut ausgestattet. Shayna war sehr freundlich und hat uns Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt gegeben. In Bruce, diese superhübsche Katze, haben wir uns sofort verliebt .Wir haben uns jedes mal gefreut, wenn wir sie sahen.<br/>Das Haus liegt sehr zentral, Straßenbahn gleich um die Ecke, ebenso Supermarkt und tolle Restaurants. Wilbert war wirklich sehr entgegenkommend  - wir durften am letzten Tag unsere Koffer noch einige Stunden länger  bei ihm lassen, dazu  er hat uns sogar noch zum Bahnhof gefahren.

44,32132992,5/14/2015,Thatiana,"Wilbert is very friendly and helpful. He is very fast in replying all messages I wrote to him during my stay. Besides his positive attitude, his room is cute, clean and well located. I strong recommed have Wilbert as your host if you intend to visit Amsterdam."
44,32454188,5/18/2015,Marko,"Wilbert was very friendly and eager to share all kinds of interesting spots for photos which was exactly what I was after. We chatted for a bit and shared a glass of great wine  in his lovely home, and he was most gracious about everything.<br/><br/>I really liked the spaciousness of the room and how everything is well thought out. Nice large bed. Lots of room for clothes. Super clean. Nothing feels cheap.<br/><br/>Shower is awesome - Really nice safe neighbourhood away from the ruckus. I biked everywhere and Wilbert was cool with lending me his bike - super nice.<br/><br/>Most Highly recommended!"
44,32683651,5/20/2015,Stuart,"The studio apartment was absolutely beautiful, even more so than described in its photographs. Though up four very steep and narrow stairwells, the top floor was an oasis of quiet and calm. Large windows let in a great deal of light, the newly refurbished shower was very welcome after a long day of wet walking in the streets, and the tiny kitchenette was well furbished with cookware and dishes. The bed was also very comfortable, and Wilbert was concise and clear with his directions, so getting there from the airport was an easy affair. "
44,32956111,5/24/2015,Heider,"Minha estada em Amsterdam não poderia ter sido melhor! Wilbert estava lá na chegada, me ajudou com as malas, explicou tudo sobre o quarto e deu dicas ótimas sobre a cidade. O local é amplo, ventilado, bem arrumado, tem chuveiro privativo e silencioso. A localização é a melhor possível. Vale muito a pena!! "
44,33565744,5/30/2015,Rick,"We had a lovely stay at Vondel House! Wilbert was a friendly host - he gave us helpful tips and the checkin/checkout process was very smooth. The room was exactly as it looked in the photos, and it was comfortable, clean and spacious. The private shower and toilet facilities were equally clean, as well as modern. The location was especially great - right next to the beautiful Vondelpark, easily accessible to all tourist attractions and Amsterdam Centraal station, in addition to lots of nice cafes and restaurants nearby. Thank you Wilbert for hosting us!<br/>- Best wishes from Sharon and Rick"
44,33944847,6/2/2015,Fernando,"Great Place to stay few days in Amsterdam, easy to arrive with 1 line from city center/station or even walking its a nice walk. There is everything you need in the neighborhood, restaurants, bar, park, coffeshops, etc."
44,34067647,6/4/2015,Shelby,Wilbert was very friendly and a great host. His apartment was conveniently located and very clean and comfortable. We had a very good last weekend in Amsterdam here. :)
44,34281274,6/7/2015,Amanda,"Great location. Close to the tram, stores and museums! The room itself was clean and bright. There was enough room to put all of our stuff! The bed was comfortable (important). Wilbert was so kind to go through everything and was willing to answer any questions and made sure we knew he was available if we needed anything at another time. It was a great experience. Thank you Wilbert!"
44,34874707,6/13/2015,Felipe,"Wilbert was a friendly and helpful host and I have no complaints whatsoever. The apartment is nicely located: walking distance to Van Gogh and Rijks museums. Very close to the Vondel Park and to the Tram stop.<br/>The neighborhood is close enough to the city centre without being too noisy. The room is well equipped with a comfortable bed and spacious shower. The only thing that could be an issue are the stairs: the narrow steps might be uncomfortable if you carry heavy luggage. "
44,35446123,6/19/2015,Jamie,Wilbert was very helpful in getting me settled in the place. And the place itself was amazing. It had a lot of room and really everything we needed to be comfortable in it. We had a great time!
44,35663228,6/21/2015,Annemiek,"The room was great, just like in the pictures! Wilbert was very friendly, and took the time to explain everything and provide us with useful tips. We also borrowed one of his bikes, which was very convenient. The location of the room is also amazing: next to the Vondelpark and close to many stores, markets, restaurants, etc. <br/>Will definitely stay here again when I decide to return to Amsterdam!"
44,35936974,6/23/2015,Chrystal,"Wilbert was a super friendly and welcoming host. He helped me carry my luggage up 3 flight of stairs, helped to print my tickets for the Heineken experience and always answer any questions that i had promptly! The accommodation is clean, furnished and located in a wonderful neighbourhood that is convenient :) Head's up though to people intending to travel across Europe and are bringing a big luggage that the stairs are pretty steep and it'll be quite an exercise carrying your luggages up and down. But other than that, the accommodation and host are awesome!"
44,36275890,6/27/2015,Sheila,"Vondel House is a lovely place to stay.  The apartment is nicely furnished and roomy.  Close to good restaurants, tram transportation and the Park.  Wilbert is an excellent host and goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable and at home.  I would definitely return!"
44,36684547,6/30/2015,Jennifer,"The room was perfect for two with a good vibe and great location, close to the tram. Wilbert was a wonderful and accommodating host - happy to give suggestions for restaurants, and even offered to help me with my suitcase up the stairs! Fabulous experience overall."
44,36945427,7/3/2015,Chris,The room was so nice and the location is so convenient to go to city centers and museums(by trams). The private shower room was also fantastic!
44,37663615,7/9/2015,Yao Sheng,"I found Wilbert and his place at Vondel park to be excellent. The house is located near to the park and in a very pleasant neighbourhood with interesting ethnic food, places for lunch/breakfast and a bike rental shop. It is also quite near a tram line to Amsterdam Central.<br/><br/>The room is exactly like as in the pictures. Very clean and modern and well equipped. Wilbert as a host was very friendly and accommodating. All in all and very good Air Bnb experience."
44,37851436,7/11/2015,Kherlen,I loved Wilbert's apartment. It had everything that you needed including small kitchenette and location wise it was few tram stops away from city center.  P.S.: Amsterdam is a small city :) In the night I was able to sleep well because this area was located in the living area. Will definitely come again and stay there :)
44,38105811,7/13/2015,Edgardo,"Wilbert fue muy cálido con nosotros, el departamento es muy muy cómodo, está muy cerca del centro. Muy muy recomendable. Nos hemos sentido muy bien, descansamos por las noches ya que es muy tranquilo el barrio. Wilbert nos ayudó para recomendarnos lugares buenos para visitar. Hermosa experiencia"
44,38394653,7/15/2015,Diego,"Wilbert was very nice and welcoming. His flat was a great choice, centrally located and 2 blocks from the Tram stop as well as several interesting restaurants, shops and OT301 (A pretty awesome club - Ping Pong on Tuesday night!!!).  The bed was super comfortable and everything was neatly organized and clean. I highly recommend his flat to anyone, except those who may have issues with steep steps."
44,38708147,7/18/2015,Ruby,Beautiful clean unit. Great location. Wilbert was extremely accommodating and helpful! I would recommend staying here to everyone and would definitely stay again! Thanks Wilbert

44,39552643,7/24/2015,Samuel,"Wilbert is really nice host. Just after the reservation he sent me a message to tell that there will be no problem to let my bagage in his place when i will check-out.<br/><br/>Explanations to come from airport was really clear.<br/><br/>Wilbert was very friendly. Nice welcoming to see together the accommodation. It's a nice and functional room with private shower (exactly like on the pictures). Very quiet area (view on the garden).<br/><br/>The place near the vondelpark is awesome to visit Amsterdam (it was my first trip in this city). You have tram in 200m, if you like walking you can go in the most part of the city from this place.<br/><br/>Thank you very much to Wilbert."
44,39752694,7/26/2015,Stefan,"Zimmer, Gastgeber und Lage der Unterkunft ist super. Konnten alles fußläuig erreichen und Wilbert war sehr gastfreundlich. Zimmer sieht aus wie auf den Fotos und war sauber. Nur zu empfehlen."
44,40159800,7/28/2015,Mountan,"This was our best air bnb experience. The location was great, the room and private shower were amazing,and Wilbert was the most accommodating, kind host we have had. The room was very much like our own private apartment.  Wilbert will do everything he can to make you comfortable and accommodated. We were able to use his bikes ( we popped a tire) and he still let us stay another night free of charge because it was available and we hadn't made a reservation anywhere for that night. He's readily available in the next building over and made our experience a special one. Thank you wilbert ! Awesome stay"
44,40902992,8/3/2015,Ralf,"Wilbert was a great host, very relaxed and helpful. He even exceptionally borrowed me his personal bike because one of the guest bikes was temporarily not available.<br/>I would always come back."
44,41294595,8/5/2015,Jens-Peter,"Alles war wunderbar & unkompliziert! Das Zimmer, Wilbert, Amsterdam! Ich würde das Zimmer immer weiter empfehlen..."
44,41596513,8/8/2015,Jonatan,"Anfitrião foi bastante hospitaleiro comigo. O quarto é limpo e arejado. Ambiente possui tudo que é necessário em termos de comodidade para o visitante. A localização da moradia é excelente e próxima a todas atrações, mas com vizinhança tranquila. Pesquisei várias opções antes de ficar na Vondel House. Recomendo pelo custo-benefício que é proporcionado."
44,42372423,8/13/2015,Ai,"Wilburt is very accommodating and helpful, the room is very clean, has everything you need, spacious, comfortable & very VERY well-located. You can walk easily to the centre, alternatively tram stop is super close. I'll definitely come back!!"

44,43475156,8/20/2015,Deborah,Wilbert was very welcoming on the first day and showed us around the room. He was very helpful when we had inquiries about Amsterdam.
44,43924368,8/23/2015,Annika,Nett und flexibel! Alles super.
44,44804337,8/29/2015,Miguel,"Perfect. Cordial and friendly host going the extra mile. Clean, modern and super central apartment private room. I would stay here in my next visit to Amsterdam."
44,45247355,9/1/2015,Ola,"I was very pleased and satisfied with the accommodation and the host. Wilbert is very warm and welcoming, he replies to messages right away and is ready to help if needed. The room is clean, everything in there was available, according to the description. The neighbourhood is my favourite part of Amsterdam, just next to the beautiful Vondelpark; very quiet and not as crowded as other parts, although still pretty near to the centre of the city."
44,45553338,9/4/2015,Libby,"Wilbert was extremely friendly, polite and helpful. The accom is very beautiful and easily accessible by tram to most Amsterdam landmarks. I highly recommend this accom and it'll be my first choice for when I visit Amsterdam again."
44,45955067,9/7/2015,Giselle,"The stay was great, the room is just like in the pictures clean big pretty. Wilbert was very nice and accommodating. The neighborhood is great! Residential, with restaurants and a block away from the tram which is just like 2-3 stops from the center, one can even walk it's about 15-20 mins not too far at all! Overall a great stay!"
44,46864452,9/14/2015,Monica,"I stayed a week in Amsterdam. Wilbert was waiting for my arrival and guided me to the unit and helped with my luggage. The unit is exactly what you see in the photos, spacious, comfortable and with a lot of light. The shower has been upgraded with a very modern spa looking style. The appartment is very well located, supermarkets and other shops are a block away, one block from the favoulus Vondelpark ( a big park like Central Park). A couple of blocks away from the art museums and all tourist attractions. The public transportation is great in Amsterdam and the appartment is closed to several trams stops. I confessed that I did not use it very often because all attractions are walking distance from the appartment. Walking in Amsterdam is easy and enjoyable. Wilbert is an outstanding host , he was very helpful, provided very useful information and called the taxicab to take me to the airport. I recommend his place, to get more tgan what you pay."
44,47186815,9/16/2015,Azam,Two awesome days spent. Wilbert is an amazing host. He went above and beyond. The room was a decent size. The bathroom fittings are brand new. It was really nice.
44,47635172,9/21/2015,Ralph,"As a guest staying at Wilbert's place for the second time: everything was perfect again; <br/><br/>Many thanks Wilbert!"
44,48272988,9/25/2015,Hans & Jillian,Wonderful host and lovely room in a great location with good food and easy access to trams. Highly recommended but the stairs are steep.
44,49300613,10/2/2015,Eduardo,Wilbert was very kind to me and very accessible. His room was very comfortable and big enough for 2 persons. The location is very nice and close to everything. I highly recommend it to every independet traveller visiting Amsterdam.
44,49976823,10/8/2015,Cassie,Everything about the apartment was perfect..granted it's slightly outside the main area but I truly enjoy that. Being in the center of the action and retreating to quiet and the park or your local bar. There was a mishap with the bike that made the end of our trip quite unfortunate and for that reason I would not stay here again. But it has been handled by Airbnb thoughtfully and for that I would definitely recommend staying here for the location. 
44,50299029,10/11/2015,Anton,"Everything was all right! Clean room, good area! I really can recommend it!!!"
44,50701793,10/13/2015,Amy,"Loved the room! It is shown as pictured - clean with a private shower. The little kitchenette is perfect and the separate toilet (right outside the door) is also clean and easily shareable with the other room. <br/><br/>The shower is updated & modern! Bright windows. The location is very safe and you feel like a local but it's near busy streets and some great eats! <br/><br/>I arrived early and Wilbert allowed me to drop off some luggage and killed some time at the local coffeeshop at the corner. Perfect place and I'd love to visit Amsterdam again and stay here."
44,50925685,10/16/2015,Gladys,"The room is pretty big, the bed super comfy and the shower is awesome! Warning: no elevator. Room is on the 4th floor, but Wilbert was kind enough to help me with my luggage. The neighborhood is lovely! Lots of restaurants and cute coffee shops and stores, not touristy at all. I felt super safe walking around at nighttime. I fell in love with Amsterdam, and when I come back I'm staying here again for sure! "
44,51261410,10/19/2015,Isabelle,"Nous sommes venus pour le marathon, géographiquement cet appartement est bien situé. Nous avons pu aller au Stadium Olympique à pied. Pour se déplacer il y a un arrêt du tram 1 juste à côté. Quelques restos à proximité. <br/>La literie est bonne, les photos représentent la réalité et l'environnement est calme. <br/>Wilbert nous a bien accueilli, il nous a communiqué les informations nécessaires pour rejoindre l'appartement depuis la Gare Centraal. <br/>"
44,51833465,10/24/2015,Wim,"Wilbert was a great host - the room definately lives up to the expectations, and he's a very flexible and friendly person. due to problems with the train, i arrived two hours later than announced, but Wilbert didn't mind.<br/>i would definately book the room again."
44,51949804,10/25/2015,Mariko,"Wilbert was a great host, he helped me carrying up my heavy suitcase(21kg!) to the 4th floor. The city was beautiful in autumn. Liked the park close to the apartment and Bagle & Beans on the corner for breakfast. Thanks Wilbert :)"
44,52260274,10/27/2015,Lili,"3日間滞在しました｡<br/>ｱﾑｽﾃﾙﾀﾞﾑ中央駅からはﾄﾗﾑで15分程度の距離にあり､繁華街へ徒歩で行くには少し距離があります｡<br/>ﾎｽﾄとは､小まめに連絡を取ることができ､安心して宿泊することができました｡"
44,52577678,10/31/2015,Krista,"Wilbert was absolutely charming.  He met me at the door to give me a tour of the apartment and facilities.  He also accommodated an early arrival, which I very much appreciated after an 11.5 hour flight!  The apartment is perfectly located, with very easy access to the core area.  Transit is very close, and Wilbert's instructions for transfer from the airport are impeccable, the process was very easy.  The apartment is well laid out with lots of closet space, a private sink and shower, and the toilet just outside the room.  I didn't use the kitchenette but it seemed well stocked with dishes, etc.  I didn't lack for anything, and the four flights of stairs helped me work off all the bread and cheese I ate!  Thanks Wilbert for helping to make my visit perfect."
44,54003744,11/15/2015,Anton,"Once again, nothing to complain! Everything is like Wilbert described it! Thanks for the uncomplicated stay - it is a nice and clean room in a great area!!!"
44,54373707,11/19/2015,Josephine,"This is a good place to stay: the listing and the reviews are accurate - Wilbert is a friendly, helpful and interesting host and the room is well equipped, spacious and comfortable. There are 4 flights of steep, narrow stairs to climb, but Wilbert gives a hand with the bags; the shower is really good; the toilet is just outside the room and shared with Wilbert's other guest room.<br/>The location is excellent, quiet but only a few minutes from a tram line to the centre and a short walk from the Vondel Park, major museums and the concert hall. Plenty of shops and cafes nearby. "
44,54728604,11/23/2015,Karina,The room is exactly as described and the neighborhood is nice. Wilbert is a kind person and helpful. I had a wonderful stay in Amsterdam! 
44,55193404,11/29/2015,Erwin,"Zeer gastvrij ontvangen, prima plek in de buurt van het Leidseplein, Paradiso en Melkweg. Deze locatie heeft alles als je een weekend in Amsterdan wilt verblijven. Openbaar vervoer vlakbij (Overtoom) evenals prima plekken om te ontbijten of een borrel te drinken."
44,55949684,12/7/2015,Jan,"It was a great pleasure to meet Wilbert! :) The apartment was as clean and nice as it is depicted on Airbnb. The neighbourhood was great, near Vondelpark and an Albert Heijn was really close by as well. <br/><br/>I'll definitely try to stay at Wilbert's again next time I'm in Amsterdam!! <br/><br/>Highly recommended! "
44,57125717,12/22/2015,Benjamin,"Once I got to the place, Wilbert greeted me with warmth and enthusiasm, and carried my bag all the way up to the 4th floor.  The place was how it was described, and I had a great stay in Amsterdam.  It was an outstanding jumping off point to explore the Vondelspark, the Museumplein, and the surrounding neighborhoods.  I know Amsterdam well, but had never stayed in this neighborhood before and it had many hidden treasures, including one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in Amsterdam across the street.  I also commuted into Leiden one day, and found it incredibly convenient.  I would stay again!  "
44,57681542,12/28/2015,Thagiso,Wilbert made me feel very welcome. He text me when I arrived and we communicated leading up to the stay.. Afterwards I got the privacy I wanted. The apartment was clean and tidy as advertised.
44,58117758,1/1/2016,Anita,"Wilbert è una persona molto simpatica e disponibile. Appena arrivati ci ha fornito tutte le informazioni necessarie per il nostro soggiorno. La posizione della camera era ottimale, a nemmeno un chilometro di distanza dal centro di Amsterdam. "
44,58791026,1/5/2016,Cristina,"My daughter and I spent four lovely nights at Wilbert's room near Vondelpark.  We loved the location as it was very close to everything we were looking for.  The room was well equipped with a small kitchenette and shower with a separate toilet right next door.  The highlight was Wilbert's hospitality, he was very kind to us and brought our bags up to the room as well as bringing them down when we left.  It was lovely to have met such a friendly host.  Would recommend Wilbert's room and will definitely return again.  "
44,59423681,1/10/2016,Alice,"Wilbert was incredibly helpful and hospitable, and very communicative both leading up to my stay as well as during my stay. He pointed me in the right directions for the shops I was after, gave me a detailed tour of the room and utilities. The room was exactly as expected (although I must say the shower was particularly nice!) and in a great location, right next to Vondelpaark."
44,60515780,1/24/2016,Auryane,"Super studio , bien placé, wilbert et super gentil et nous a bien accueillis . Nous reviendrons avec plaisir ."

44,62523585,2/15/2016,Lauren,Wilbert is very friendly and provided helpful recommendations tailored to my interests.  He was flexible with his timing when I ran into delays on my way to check in.  The room is as advertised and in an area close to trams and several museums.

44,64273318,3/1/2016,Erik,Great place! Great shower and clean too.<br/>Wilbert is very friendly and helpfull host.<br/>Place is in center in nice neighbourhood.
44,64642357,3/6/2016,Hedley,"Wilbert was there to meet us and he immediately made us feel very welcome. The guest room is on the top of a four-storey building; like many Dutch city houses the stairs are steep and narrow and you need to be reasonably fit to manage them.  The studio was very warm and clean.  The kitchen is OK for breakfast, and for a micro-wave supper.  The shower was great; the toilet is shared with an adjoining studio.  Good views over a quiet residential area at the back.  Good location with easy access to a no.1 tram and the Vondel Park.  The Rijksmuseum and the van Gogh museum can be reached on foot.  We'd go back without hesitation.<br/>One word of warning: if you are going by car, there is no economical long-term parking in the street.  You have to use the Park and Ride parks.  The nearest one is at the Olympic Stadium.  Make sure you know how the Park and Ride ticket system works.  It is not straight-forward and it is well worth taking a few minutes out to study its intricacies.  In particular keep the Park and Ride bus/tram/metro ticket you receive when you leave your car.  And make sure you use it when you return to pick up your car.  Otherwise it becomes very expensive (€50 a day at weekends) and you will join a long queue of similarly placed visitors who are not getting much sympathy from the hard-pressed staff at the car parking reception."
44,65054726,3/10/2016,Rens,Het was een geweldige accomodatie met veel luxe en een aardige gastheer.
44,65334652,3/13/2016,Alicia,"We had a wonderful stay. The place is well located, near the beautiful Vondel park. The room is quiet (you can sleep very well) and fully equipied with all you need. It has even more things than those shown in photos. The facilities are new, and includes your own super shower in the room.<br/>Wilbert is a super host, nice and helpful. He was kind enought to allow us an early check-in, and keep our lugagge after checking out (we thank you for that!!!). Otherwise he is an artist, and took part of his time un showing us some pices of his wonderful work. We believe it would be shown in a modern arte museum. If we come back to Amsterdam, we'll stay here again."
44,66782218,3/24/2016,José,The location was perfect! Wilbert was a very kind and helpful host! the room was clean and very cozy
44,67347443,3/28/2016,Assia,"Amsterdam was amazing ! And the room as well :) better than an hotel, very quiet, there is all you need, and Wilbert was very nice and helpful at the check in.

44,67591691,3/30/2016,Leana,"Wilbert was an amazing host, very responsive and really nice. The room was nice, a bit cozier than it looks like in the pictures.

44,68010686,4/1/2016,Alex,"Wilbert was waiting there for my arrival, he  was very friendly and welcoming and was eager to help and answer any of my questions.<br/>This was my first time in Amsterdam and I don't know anyone there, so<br/>it was very comforting to know that I could always call Wilbert with any question."
44,68911623,4/7/2016,Emma,"I had a wonderful time staying with Wilbert! The room was beautiful and well-equipped, it was in a nice neighborhood with good restaurants and shops nearby, and it was very easy to get to public transit. Wilbert was lovely and very helpful! "
44,69947460,4/15/2016,Jimmy,"It's hard to express in words the gratitude I have for Wilbert, first he was an amazing host, made sure I felt at home and did everything in his power to make sure it was a memorable trip.  His place is perfect for anyone who wants to have a relaxing stay in the Amsterdam West away from all the hectic tourists in the city center.  <br/><br/>The neighborhood is beautiful, 2 minutes away from Vondelpark, tons of places to eat without hurting your wallet and so many friendly people.  The apartment was perfect, newly renovated with all the necessities with a full kitchenette, shower, king size bed and was so comfy it felt like home.<br/><br/>It only takes a 15 min tram ride into the city center, but I spent most of my time locally exploring Foodhallen, Vondelpark and markets on Kinkerstraat.  I will definitely do my best to come back next year, Amsterdam is my new home away from home.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and book with Wilbert if you are planning on staying in Amsterdam, you won't regret it!!"
44,71185500,4/24/2016,Mihai,"Thanks to Wilbert we felt at home during our 3 nights stay at the Vondel House.

44,72029341,4/30/2016,Isabelle,"Nous été parfaitement accueillies par Wilbert qui est un hôte charmant. La chambre était parfaite. Pour les petits-dejeuners, nous conseillons ""Wilhemina"" dans la rue. Wilbert a été tout à fait à notre écoute et nous avons beaucoup apprécié les services qu'il nous a rendu. La chambre n'est pas très loin des musées et le quartier est très calme. Nous conseillons l'adresse sans problème."
44,72354546,5/2/2016,Rae,"The room was very comfortable and in a good location. It is easy to get to from the airport or centraal station. The neighborhood is cool and there are plenty of places to eat in the area. The room is also equipped with a fridge, micro oven, tea/coffee maker, dishes and sink, so if you want you can prepare food here as well.<br/><br/>The building has all been remodeled to modern standards and the room has a very nice private shower and a shared toilet. Being on the 5th floor was no problem for us, however for someone with knee or back issues it would not be recommended.<br/><br/>Wilbert is a very good host and an interesting person. He was incredibly friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome away from home. <br/><br/>Highly recommended! We would stay here again."
44,74554699,5/15/2016,Yao,"Wilbert is a very nice and very kind person, he is always like to help people to solve problems.  During our trip on Barcelona, my wife's handbag stolen at Barcelona Airport Hotel. We lost everything: Money, Passport, Green cards, cell phone.....  Wilbert give us advise of how to handle this, help us check the US Consulate's location, ride us to US Consulate several times, print out our document whenever we needed...  Thanks to Wilbert, with your help , everything goes fine.<br/><br/>Wilbert's room is quite and clean, 5 minutes walk distance to a supermarket. Close to public transportation,    you can easily take tram #1, #12 to Museum Square, to Central Station and to Airport.<br/><br/>Thanks Wilbert, your hospitality and kindness give us an unforgettable experience.  "
44,75141749,5/19/2016,Patrick,"Everything was perfect. Wilbert was waiting for me when I got there. He is really friendly and helpful. <br/><br/>The room is super clean, spacious and quiet. Great part of Amsterdam. Right next to Vondel Park. Restaurants and the tram are right outside the door. <br/><br/>I hope this room is available next time I visit."
44,75458453,5/21/2016,Monika,"All great, nice neighbourhood, not far from the centre, good value. Wilbert is very nice and welcoming. "
44,77072020,5/30/2016,RodneyRia,Wilbert was a very hospitable and gracious host.  We spent 10 nights in a very comfortable private room.  The views into the back gardens is pleasant and amazingly quite. A very convenient local for transport and restaurants. Travel time to and from Schiphol is under 30 minutes and the main shopping areas a pleasant 30minute walk.    With my bad knees I did find the stairs to very steep! Thank you once again Wilbert.
44,78712736,6/8/2016,George,"Wilbert greeted me even though I was late coming off the train from Schipol.  He gave me a few ideas of museums to look at during my stay and was very thorough on the logistics of the room, key code, lights etc. <br/><br/>Have a wonderful stay."
44,78955666,6/10/2016,Raj,"Awesome room and host! Wilbert was very kind and the instructions were very clear. The room was very cozy and comfortable in a fantastic location near public transit and the park. Clean! Yes, the stairs are steep!"
44,79448451,6/12/2016,Martin Yu Kong,Nice host. Check-in time is flexible. Location is easy to be found. Near to main stations and town centre. 
44,80553674,6/18/2016,Barbara,"A comfortable, clean and very quiet room with a nice view to the back garden and the evening sky. Total privacy guaranteed. Convenient location to Shipool and downtown. Last but not least Wilbert is a very friendly and helpful host. Great hospitality. Thank you, Wilbert, I hope to come again."
44,81534696,6/23/2016,Su,"Wilbert met us on arrival and was consistently communicative throughout our stay. He gave us ideas and suggestions that fitted our interests and proved valuable.<br/>Location was great - Vondel Park nearby and easy access to trams. Although we usually walked the teams were great in wet weather.<br/>The room was spacious and light with a great shower and comfortable beds. We were unsure about sharing a toilet, but that proved to be no problem, and we didn't ever meet any other guests.<br/>As mentioned, it's on the 4th floor. Stairs are narrow - as in all Amsterdam apartments. However, we didn't mind this as it meant we has a quiet room & slept soundly on comfortable beds. The room is well designed & we were very comfortable.<br/>I intend returning to stay if I can as it suited my needs perfectly and Wilbert was an excellent host."
44,81947479,6/25/2016,Veverie,"Wilbert is a great host! We can easily contact him by text and he always reply it soon. Also, the apartment is very comfortable. The street nearby is quiet and beautiful, the house is clean and bright. Everything is great for this trip. "
44,82986563,6/30/2016,Lucy,"This was my second time staying here and again, it was great! Wilbert made us feel very welcome. I stayed with 4 friends in both of his rooms and everyone enjoyed their stay. Definitely would recommend to anyone who is looking to stay in Amsterdam."
44,83886742,7/4/2016,Claudy,"The flat look even better than in the pictures. Very well located. The host was very helpful, always available to help when needed. "
44,84316701,7/6/2016,J,"I had the pleasure of staying in both rooms at Wilbert's Vondel House and had a lovely experience in both. The rooms are spacious, clean, and super comfortable. The location is also excellent. Wilbert is an excellent host and I highly recommend staying with him!"
44,85462772,7/11/2016,Daniel,Lovely nice clean apartment. Everything felt new and especially the shower was a treat. Would recommend
44,86813004,7/17/2016,Hakan,"Wir wurden sehr nett und offen begrüßt, haben dann auch eine kleine Führung durch Wilberts private Wohnung bekommen. Da wir etwas früh waren, haben wir unser Gepäck vor Ort verstaut und sind noch unterwegs gewesen bis zum Check-In. Danach bekamen wir Hilfe vom Gastgeber beim Gepäck tragen, da das Stiegenhaus in Amsterdam recht steil gebaut ist. <br/>Wir waren im Großen und Ganzen sehr zufrieden mit dem Zimmer und der Lage."
44,87658458,7/21/2016,Richard,Wilbert was very available to meet with me and explained everything. He was a very good host . The accommodation was private clean and secure. 
44,89694717,7/29/2016,Michael,Best shower in AMS and the location near Vondelpark was perfect.  I've stayed in 4 AMS airbnbs over the last few years.  Wilbert's was the best.
44,90449712,8/1/2016,Florence,"Wilbert is a great and passionate host (go have a look at his work if you have time), it was a pleasure to meet him and commmunication was very easy. The room is spacious, very well located and extremly quiet, exactly as described. The bed is very confortable. Everything is there to enjoy Amsterdam ! I would recommend this place with no hesitation :)"
44,91233044,8/4/2016,Arik,"Wilbert was a fantastic host! The residence was very comfortable, I would definitely stay there again!"
44,92822921,8/10/2016,Andre,"Wilbert was warm , friendly and always there to help. Clean and nearby. Great host!"
44,93576963,8/13/2016,Hyogem,Great accommodation. And Willbert is very kind. I stayed that very comfortable.
44,96029703,8/21/2016,Étienne,"Wilbert est un réel gentleman! Rien a dire sinon que nous avons vécu mon épouse et moi un séjour magnifique! La proximité de l'appartement à tout, restos, musées, sorties, etc.! Si je dois absolument trouver un point négatif,  je dirais ceci: l'appartement est situé au troisième étage ce qui veut dire beaucoup d'escaliers à monter (attention personnes âgées et très jeunes enfants) "
44,96765854,8/24/2016,Steve,"My stay at the Vondel Guest house was perfect. Wilbert was a fantastic host. Amsterdam is such a beautiful city, so being within walking distance to the center was fantastic. The park is literally at the front door of the house. To make things even easier, just rent a bike at the shop just a block or two away. I would definitely stay at the guest house again the next time I'm in town "
44,97464483,8/27/2016,Tony,"From the moment of finding the accommodation and first speaking with the host Wilbert it was excellent communication. Wilbert was always a message away with fast replies and he was there to great us on our arrival, to ensure we had all the information we needed to make our stay pleasant as it can be. The accommodation was very clean and facilities to a very high standard.<br/><br/>Wilbert also added extra's, such as clean fresh towels and UK plug adaptors.<br/><br/>Room is very secure too, with a very advanced locking system on the room door.<br/><br/>The room we stayed in Guest room 2 is on the 4th floor and the floors are very narrow and steep, so this should be born in mind, but Wilbert does clearly mention this in his listing and as far as we are concerned the stairs didn't bother us.<br/><br/>So, a big thank you to our host Wilbert and we hope to visit again soon.<br/><br/>Holland is a beautiful country with the most wonderful people, and Wilbert is a fine representative..."
44,97690760,8/28/2016,Chris,"The first thing you will notice when you meet Wilbert is that he is super intelligent and a gentlemen.  Architect by trade and his hobby is Meccano (you will see some pretty impressive build by Will if you are lucky).<br/><br/>This room is spacious with shower room attached, small pantry to make coffee or tea with refrigerator plus a sink to do your morning business.  Located about 5 mins from tram stop and 25 mins to city, this is a perfect location for anyone looking for a peaceful night sleep.<br/><br/>I will definitely come back and stay at Wilbert's place again.  "
44,99057541,9/3/2016,Luc,"Zeer nette kamer, goed comfort, wel 4 hoog, goed voor de conditie, misschien minder voor oudere mensen. "
44,99383761,9/4/2016,Jérémy,Wilbert est un hôte très accueillant et chaleureux. Il s'adapte facilement à nos demandes. Je n'hésiterai pas à le recommander.
44,101135140,9/12/2016,Winfried,"Wilbert war ein perfekter Gastgeber. Das kleine und feine Appartement ist völlig ausreichend für eine Reise zu zweit. Kleine Küche mit Ofen und Kühlschrank ist auch vorhanden. Lage ist für einen gemütlichen Amsterdam Trip ebenfalls Ideal. Mit der Tram 1 ist man rasch in der City. Tram, Supermarkt und einige nette lokale und Bars sind im 5 Minuten Umkreis zu erreichen. Appartement ist super ruhig, abseits von der sicherlich lauten Partymeile. <br/>Ich würde dieses Appartement jederzeit wieder buchen und jedem empfehlen."
44,102465990,9/18/2016,Amir,"I actually wasn't expecting a really friendly, helpful and conversational host, but that is exactly what I had. Wilbert from when I booked till the moment I got into my taxi to the airport was friendly, helpful and conversational. Very quick to respond to messages; Wilbert answered any question I had even if her couldn't full fill my request he definitely made sure he found a solution for me. He is also an intelligent man which allows for great discussions. Very pleased to have met him. <br/><br/>Guest room 2 was exactly as described and shown, my favourite parts; the shower, the awesome digital handle lock on the door and the microwave which is quality. The bathroom is literally next to the room so you don't have to travel far and it is very nice. <br/><br/>The location is PERFECT. There is a fantastic bagel cafe called Bagels & Beans just around the corner which is where I had my breakfast and along Overtoom (which is the main road just round the corner) are coffee shops, cafes, a Starbucks (if there are any lovers of it) Dominos and a really great selection of restaurants, my favourite was a burger joint just a 5 minute walk called Artisani. I really could go on. <br/><br/>I was extremely lucky to have been in Amsterdam during a full week of sunshine so I literally walked everywhere and it was easy. I was so close to all the main attractions and walking through the park everyday to get to them was refreshing, I could simply just lay on the grass and relax. From the park/museums it was easy walking into the city centre. I had actually walked around the city so much that when my internet cut out and I couldn't use (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, I found my way back very easily, thanks to a few points in the right direction all I had to do was ask which way to Overtoom. <br/><br/>My mistake was not renting a bike from the moment I arrived, the tram is great to go on during bad weather and for the experience (tram 1 which is located on Overtoom), but the real fun was cycling around the city and I believe there are 3 bike rental shops on Overtoom, I rented from MacBike. <br/><br/>So just to conclude:<br/>- Great host who you can trust and rely on<br/>- You are getting exactly what you see in the pictures and description<br/>- Fantastic location with an abundance of things to do close by"
44,105006802,9/29/2016,Benjamin,Great experience with this place. Host was very helpful and friendly and the price is reasonable. I would check in here again when in Amsterdam.
44,105750077,10/2/2016,Luciane,"Wilbert was very nice to me, we were in touch by what's up before my arrival and he always answered very fast. He helped with my luggage since the room is in the 4-th floor. The room is new, clean and comfortable. I recommend the place."
44,106793809,10/8/2016,Steven,Really loved this apartment. Clean; comfortable and the perfect location for exploring the museums & galleries. Loads of restaurants close by made eating out really convenient. Wilbert was a great host & made a real effort to make me feel welcome & comfortable. He was always available to offer advice. This was my first experience of booking accommodation throughout Airbnb & it exceeded my expectations.
44,107525877,10/10/2016,Catherine,"Super accueil de Willem qui a pris le temps de nous donner tous les détails sur la chambre. N'hésitez pas à réserver un peu de temps à Willem pour qu'il vous explique sa passion des meccano...superbe collection. <br/>L'emplacement est idéal, au calme et à 200 mètres du tram. Et la chambre est spacieuse et confortable, la kitchenette est très pratique. "
44,108951295,10/18/2016,Alex,Every necessity was provided in a very carefully thought out and restful room. Many thanks to Wilbert for being able to greet me late at night.
44,109191952,10/20/2016,Juergen,All good
44,110051471,10/24/2016,Samantha,"This is a great place to stay.  Wilbert greeted me and carried my bag to the top floor.  He's a very welcoming, helpful and friendly host, and showed me everything I needed to know about the guest room.  The room was very spacious, airy and light, with a lovely view of trees.  It had everything I could possibly need with details like an electric socket adaptor (I neededn't have brought my own!), spare bedding, etc.  It felt very homely and was spotlessly clean.  The ensuite shower is fantastic! <br/>I really liked the neighbourhood - Vondelpark is extremely close and there are lots of shops and cafes nearby - very easy to get into the very centre of town.  I would definitely stay here again - thank you Wilbert for making my stay effortless and enjoyable."
44,110749863,10/28/2016,Sainandan,The listing is as advertised. It's reasonably close to a tram stop meaning you will take about 20 mins to get to Amsterdam Central. Safe location with a couple of decent breakfast options close by.
44,111199041,10/30/2016,Stefanie,"Wilbert was a very nice host who welcomed me warmly. He offered me any help and was always available for any questions. <br/>The room was just like shown on the pictures, everything was clean and I felt comfortable all the time. <br/>It was very quiet, except that I could hear the neighbours sometimes, never felt really disturbed though.<br/>I would always come back and can highly recommend Wilberts room to anyone! Thank you."
44,111865769,11/2/2016,Ryan,"This is my 3rd time staying at Wilbert's Vondel House guest rooms, I've said it before and will say again, I highly recommend this accommodation.  Wilbert makes the stay great as he provides you with any info you may need, as well is available for questions whenever you may need.  Thanks again Wilbert and hopefully see you again soon!"
44,112459545,11/6/2016,Laura,"<br/>El mejor sitio para disfrutar de Amsterdam, cerca de la zona de los museos. <br/>El apartamento estaba muy limpio<br/>Lo unico que no iba muy bien era el wifi.<br/>Recomendable 100%<br/>Wilbert fué muy amable y atento . <br/><br/> THe best place to enjoy Amsterdam,  near the museum area. <br/>the apartment was very clean.<br/>the only thing that was not great was the wifi.<br/>recommended 100%<br/>Wilbert. He was very friendly."
44,113872496,11/14/2016,Harry,A really nice apartment/room with a  really nice helpful host in a nice location.
44,115011908,11/21/2016,Tiphaine,"Le studio est vraiment bien aménagé, et confortable pour un week end ou un sejour. Tres bon emplacement ! <br/>Hote accueillant, discret et disponible.<br/>Je recommande ce logement."
44,115475322,11/25/2016,Josephine,"Perfect if you want something away from the major tourist areas. The room is in a quiet neighborhood, that is still easily accessible from all the major sights. Has everything you would need, and the shared toilet is right outside the door, so no inconvenience at all. Wilbert is also very friendly and willing to accommodate to different check-in/out requirements! "
44,115902735,11/27/2016,Burak,Every thing was perfect. Wilbert was very helpful. If I turn back Amsterdam definitely I will stay his place. 
44,116616673,12/2/2016,도연,perfect location and well equipped room! this flat made my stay in Amsterdam so perfect!

44,120430410,12/10/2016,Marie,Great place and great host.  Thank you Wilbert-- Rayne
44,121011569,12/13/2016,Marcos,"Great little cozy place near the center of Amsterdam (Only 15 mins away by tram). Wilbert was a great host everything was clean and tidy. The staircase was kinda steep, but after being in different houses and shops in the Amsterdam, most of the stairs were like that. "
44,121673994,12/18/2016,Jin,The location of this place was very close to central and the place looks exactly same condition as the photo shown. It has a charming shower room inside of the room which is very convinient. I will recommend others to stat here!
44,122264654,12/22/2016,Vivien,"Central location... apartment was perfect and exactly what I needed. Restroom facilities was pretty modern and good. Room was nice, warm and cozy. There are quite a bit of stairs to walk up but hey... if you are in Amsterdam then you will be doing a lot of walking so I didn't mind it at all!! <br/>Wilbert was an awesome host. Great with communication. <br/>Cannot stress enough of how centrally this is located.. literally a couple minutes from the tram station that will connect you to anywhere within the city in minutes. An awesome gastropub (Gollem) with one of the best beer selections I have seen is walking distance from the room.. a great way to end the evening...  "
44,122809721,12/26/2016,Tyler,"I loved my stay in Wilbert's place. The room is a great size for 1-2 people and the view is incredible, assuming you like row houses! Wilbert was great to interact with when he showed me the room and during our communications throughout my stay. The 1 tram is just around the corner and the neighborhood has beautiful local character (and a grocery!). I liked the building and neighborhood so much that I booked two extra nights in Wilbert's other room."
44,123387186,12/29/2016,Maja,"Die Wegbeschreibung war einwandfrei und der Empfang sehr freundlich. Die Unterkunft ist ideal gelegen - es ist alles zu Fuss machbar, und trotzdem ist es nicht voll im Zentrum. "
44,125683277,1/7/2017,Aaron,"Amazing spot. I was planning on staying only a few days and then trying out different locations, but I was so comfortable I ended up staying four extra nights. <br/><br/>It is a very cozy room. Modern. Very comfortable pillows and bed. The shower is spectacular as well. Kitchenette and fridge is a bonus. <br/><br/>Wilbert is very nice and will make sure your stay is comfortable. "
44,126883862,1/15/2017,Inna,"Convenient place to stay, very central, provides everything one needs and is exactly as described. More suitable for young or middle age guests, because it is located on the very top flour of the building that might require some physical effort to get there. We are grateful to Wilbert for being excellent in communication and flexible on check-in and check-out times."
44,127991250,1/22/2017,Natalia,Wilbert was a great host! 
44,129334913,1/30/2017,Florence,le logement est bien placé avec le repère d'une grande avenue pour ne pas se perdre <br/>logement calme avec une literie confortable et ce qu' il faut pour se débrouiller <br/>location de vélo à proximité et des restaurants <br/>vraiment super 
44,131709561,2/13/2017,Johnny,A great location and a great host! I had a wonderful time at Wilbert's. He was very helpful with anything I needed. Thanks so much Wilbert!
44,133016165,2/20/2017,Matt,"This location is great for people that want at least a little buffer between them and all of the canals, tourists, etc.  That being said, all of that is only a short 10 or so minute walk away so I loved the location.  Some of the sites are a bit further but it gives you a great opportunity to walk the city and Amsterdam is a VERY walkable city....something you want to take advantage of.  The bed was comfortable and the shower if newly remodeled and very spacious.  This is nothing fancy but a great value which is what I was looking for since I wanted to be out exploring Amsterdam!  Wilbert was an excellent host and greeted me with a smile the moment I got out of the taxi.  He was also very responsive to messages both before and during my visit.  I would definitely stay here again.  Great for someone looking for value.  Near tram lines too so if you are not up for walking those are only steps away."
44,133846930,2/25/2017,Pai,Wilbert is very easy to keep in contact with and is welcoming! I would definitely recommend.
44,134440271,2/27/2017,Alison,My first time using Airbnb and it was a fantastic experience. Perfect room with everything you need. Loved that it was right by Vondelpark and there were great places to eat that were less crowded than being in the center. 
44,135487201,3/5/2017,Annina,"Thank you very much Wilbert for offering this very convenient accomodation, your fast and helpful communication! I enjoyed a lot staying at your place! Everything went perfect :)"
44,136715990,3/12/2017,Fab,"Good place to stay, Wilbert welcome us and is verry friendly, you feel like at home. It's really close from the center. The room is very clean, there is many place around to have lunch or even have a drink. The street is calm. First airbnb experience and it was a good one."
44,137555844,3/16/2017,Sarah,"Wilbert's room was great. My 30 something boyfriend and I were visiting Amsterdam for 3 days from Brooklyn, NY. We really enjoyed staying here. The room is charming, had great light, comfy bed and an excellent shower! Wilbert's street is beautiful and so close to the 1 (Overtoom) line and wonderfully close to Vondelpark, which was beautiful in the spring! Museumplein is just across the park and getting to and from the airport is super easy thanks to the location! We also enjoyed Cafe de Toog around the corner for breakfast and lunch. Overtoom has lots of cafes, restaurants and charming shops. The Neighborhood was quiet and charming. The 1 line goes to Amsterdam Centraal and to the Lelyland Station where you can take the Sprinter train to and from Schipol so it's really fast and affordable. I highly recommend Vondel Huis!!! "
44,139604928,3/26/2017,Johanne,"I was very happy to stay with Wilbert, everything worked smoothly, the room was very good and Wilbert was very nice and friendly and easy to cooperate with.  would definitely stay with Wilbert next time I go to Amsterdam if possible."
44,141125782,4/2/2017,Eric,We highly recommend Wilbert's place for a stay in Amsterdam. It's away from the most touristy areas but not far from the museum area. We ended up walking everywhere we went in Amsterdam including going close to the city centre. Some nice shops and restaurants  on Jan Pieter Heijestraat are very close by and frequented mainly by locals rather than tourists. Gave us a good feeling of what it would be like to live in Amsterdam. 
44,141667224,4/4/2017,Daniella,"Before, during and after check-in, Wilbert was very accommodating and easy to keep in touch with. According to airbnb, I got lucky booking at Vondel House, and indeed I was! For my first time using the service, it was a stress-free experience from start to finish. Wilbert's place was clean, well-laid out, and had everything a person would need if they're a solo traveller or travelling with a friend. I stayed in Guest Room 2. The kitchenette was brilliant for the space (loved the microwave oven!) The shower was fairly large for one person, but gorgeous! There was ample storage in the closet, and the bed was very comfortable. The trek up the stairs to the room was a bit of a workout, but if you've planned your day right, one trip down and back up won't hurt. Finally, the place is in a very convenient location, to get to trams, popular places like the museum district, and Vondelpark (a gem of a green space to stroll around in, in Amsterdam). I would definitely stay by Wilbert again!"
44,142040233,4/6/2017,Paul,"Great place to stay, good room set up with good amenities. Close to restaurants and cafes, only 25 minutes to the airport.  "
44,142398247,4/8/2017,Indira,"Wilbert es muy buen anfitrión. Tenemos todo lo que necesitamos, el cuarto es amplio y muy limpio. Está muy buen ubicado, fuimos a todos los sitios de interés a pie. Y Amsterdam es precioso. Fue un gran viaje! "
44,143545428,4/12/2017,Jake,"Wilbert was very helpful with answering our questions, particularly with travel questions and told us the best trams to get for certain locations. He also allowed us a slightly later check out than agreed even though it affected his own busy schedule and looked after our suitcases all day before our late flight home. He was easily contactable, left us to do our own thing and was in general an all round nice guy. <br/><br/>Cheers for providing such great accommodation Wilbert! "
44,144183247,4/15/2017,Aaron,"Wilbert was an excellent host. Helpful, informative and incredibly responsive. The room is clean and is in an excellent location yet still very quiet at night. I would recommend his place to anyone looking for a mic stay in Amsterdam. "
44,146046393,4/21/2017,Emilia,"Great location, quiet, nice room."
44,146537917,4/23/2017,Monika,We voelden ons erg welkom bij wilbert. Erg aardige gastheer en ondanks onze zware koffers heeft hij die allebei naar de 4de verdieping gebracht voor ons. En weer naar beneden! 
44,147149263,4/25/2017,Matt,"This accommodation was perfect for what I was looking for. The room was very clean and had everything you would need. The addition of the private shower was a really nice touch too. Wilbert was very quick to respond for requests before and during my stay which is always very helpful (as a solo traveler). My only warning is about the stairs leading up to the room. These are very steep and narrow, so if you have bulky luggage, that might be difficult to maneuver. I suggest traveling with a travel backpack (which I did) since it made it easier, but my feet were bigger than the steps so I had to take my time going up and down. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I plan to be back in the near future and I'll be sure to use Wilbert again! Proost!"
44,147906138,4/29/2017,Carolina,"El lugar tiene todo lo necesario para una estadía cómoda y agradable. Es muy limpio, la cama es muy comoda, el dpto. esta en un barrio muy tranquilo y cerca de las principales atracciones. Wilbert es un excelente anfitrión, muy predispuesto, nos ha informado bien sobre todo lo que consultamos, lugares, transporte, etc."

The room is large, bright, clean, there is a mini-kitchen and its own personal shower! The accommodation is in a good area near Vondelpark. Nearby there is a tram stop, tram №1 takes you to the city center and the Central Station.<br/>And so, it was the best experience with Airbnb! Thank you, Wilbert!"

44,152407517,5/16/2017,Zeynep,"Wilbert's place is very comfortable and close to city center by public transport. It's a 30min ride from the Schiphol airport by pıblic transport as well. He eas very responsive and helpful for everything we asked for like leaving the suitcases before check in and also for the heating. <br/>The place is in a residential and quiet place, 2 min walk to Vondel park. The touristic attraxtions are very reacheble. <br/>The bed and the pillows are comfortable. As written in the other reviews hence room no2 is on the 4th floor with very narrrow stairs you should not prefer large suitcases. I would definitely choose this place again for a short stay in this lovely city. Thank you"
44,153174636,5/20/2017,Cade,Place was amazing.  Walking distance to everything I needed.   Wilbert was very friendly and helpful.  Will visit again. 
44,154141049,5/23/2017,Simon,Superbe chambre avec tout se qui est nécessaire pour passer d'agréable moments à Amsterdam. Très près d'un super beau parc. À distance de marche de tout pour ceux qui aiment marcher. Le coin est paisible et il y a un caffé et un pub près! Identique à la description. Merci :)
44,154563013,5/25/2017,Liz,"wibert always keeps well communication with me and provide every detail i need, mostly thank him for carrying my heavy suitcase upon  check-in and out. <br/>the room is quiet and located in the center amongst the local residence area where you can find supermarket and coffee and everything is super convenient, strongly recommend to have breakfast at bagals and beans nearby, it's super"
44,155376427,5/28/2017,Anthony,We had a great time at Wilbert's place. It's in a great area and not too far from the museums and shops in central Amsterdam. The bed was comfortable and the shower and sink were nice amenities. You even have your own microwave and fridge. Wilbert himself was very nice and welcoming. He helped us with our train tickets and offered to print them out for us. Would stay again.
44,158315419,6/6/2017,Valentin,"Phenomenal place! Wilbert was a great host and super friendly. Everything about the place was top notch.

44,159474563,6/11/2017,Sirma,"We loved Wilbert's cosy attic with an amazing view of apartment's garden. The room is compact and really functional with shower, kitchen and a big closet. The area is really close to Vondelpark and Museumplein. It's a hip area with lots of locals and nice restaurants, boutiques etc yet really close to the center if you are in to partying etc. Wilbert is a great guy drinking wine with him on our last night is definitely one of the highlights of our trip. Highly recommended this is a true air bnb experience!"
44,160697072,6/15/2017,Iris,"I liked Wilbert's place because it was close to Vondel Park, which is beautiful. I could walk to the famous art galleries and museums in Amsterdam. I was close to great places to eat and a little market. And Wilbert was kind and helpful."
44,162252077,6/20/2017,Yasemin,"Wilbert is really a good house owner. Quick reply, nice welcome. If you have a short stay in Amsterdam the place is really enough and at a good location."
44,163746472,6/25/2017,Marcia,"Wilbert is a fantastic host.  He was flexible with our late arrival and very nice.  The accommodation is in a good location, close to the center and Vondelpark."
44,164672656,6/28/2017,Sammi,We had wonderful stay in Wilbert's place. He is a very nice host which helped us to carry the luggage to upstairs. Room is clean and we can have our own small kitchen and bathroom. Everything went so smooth and we r really enjoy our stay:)
44,167013191,7/5/2017,Qi,Wilbert is wonderful. He helped us to carry our luggage to the rm. He provided us extra comforter when we when asked. He gave us a lot of advices regarding to how to go about. We enjoyed our stay very much.
44,167604567,7/7/2017,Lulu,"Fantastic experience! This is my first time airbnb experience and really great to stay in Wilbert's house! 3 min walk to the market, 20min to Van Gogh museum and the national museum! Also, Wilbert is a nice and helpful host to me! Highly recommend!"
44,168426713,7/9/2017,Linsey,"Wilbert was a great host, we enjoyed chatting to him and nothing was too much trouble. Even when we locked ourselves out of the house! The apartment was in a lovely location right next to Vondel park. The room was great, very clean, amazing rainfall shower. We very much enjoyed our stay. "
44,171320073,7/17/2017,Matthias,"Wilbert is a friendly and helpful guy. The room is ok. Especially positive: microwave with baking function and a supermarket nearby. There is a shared toilet which was not very obvious for me when I booked, although he mentions it in the long description. Be aware of the park&ride parking lots at the Stadionplein. Only 96 hours are cheap, the rest is excessively expensive (I paid €140 for 6 days!)."
44,171902369,7/19/2017,Burhan,"Thank you very much for your hospitality. Wilbert checked me in and showed me some incredible toys that he had built himself. He was very fast and outgoing. I had no issues with the room. Only two things for future renters,  the room might get hot at night times since there isn't ten control or ac or fan in the room. But it wasn't anything that couldn't be handled. Last is the steep stairs, 4 flights up. Other then the stairs and an overheated night out of my stay, the room and the location are absolutely impeccable , easily asscessable and multiple ways to get to the city and back. Will recommend and stay again! Also wilbert left me alone to tour and answered any questions I had for him, felt like I rented my own home   "
44,172917115,7/22/2017,Margaret,Had a wonderful time staying in the Vondel house! We loved walking around the neighborhood and exploring the local cafes. Wilbert was such a welcoming host!
44,174284980,7/25/2017,Christophe,"Proche du centre-ville, n'hésitez pas à louer des vélos pour circuler dans la cité, le long des canaux ou dans les parcs.<br/>De bons petits restaurants à proximité de la chambre, notamment le Saffran.<br/>Essayer aussi le restaurant gastronomique De Kas. Vous découvrierez une cuisine raffinée et goûterez de délicieux vins dans un lieu original: une serre."
44,174928053,7/27/2017,Santiago,Great experience and guest!
44,175606903,7/29/2017,Shawn,"Wilbert and his place were great! Very polite and easy to talk to, had no problems with checking in and out. Location was also very convenient, right next to Vondelpark in a nice quiet neighborhood for staying at night but also very easy to get to the city center and most other places by trams."
44,176517253,7/31/2017,Tamara,"I’m sitting in our beautiful room at Wilbert’s place, enjoyed the rustling of the trees outside the windows, as the evening breeze rises.  Wilbert is an exceptional host.  He provides detailed maps, suggestions, and train schedules.  The apartment is clean and well equipped.  The shower is huge and delightful.  Wilbert graciously accommodated our schedule, even though it wasn’t easy for him.  We hope to return to this delightful abode in the heart of the Vondel Park area.  Anything in Amsterdam is easy to get to from here, and Wilbert will help you figure it out."
44,178792576,8/6/2017,Cynthia,Supergeweldige locatie!
44,180139737,8/9/2017,Efrat,"Spacious, clean and very comfortable place. The bed is exceptionally comfortable which I find to be super important. I didn't spend a lot of time at the apartment but I had everything I needed there. It's close to public transportation to/from the airport and to/from the city center and is right at the edge of the fascinating vondel park. <br/>Wilbert is an amazing host. He patiently waited for me when I arrived from the airport much later than anticipated. He helped me with the luggage and also saved me some much valuable time when he agreed to have me leave my luggage with him after checkout. A superhost indeed. I would love to come back next time I'm in Amsterdam"
44,181260618,8/12/2017,Gianluca,"Wilbert is a very kind host.<br/>He's present and helpful.<br/>The room is wide and clean.<br/>Just to know that going upstairs there are narrow steps, tipical in dutch houses.<br/>I warmly recommend Wilbert's like host!"
44,182152884,8/14/2017,Lucy,"Couldn't recommend this place enough. Great location and lovely neighbourhood to stay in. The apartment was a nice size, perfect for 2 people."
44,183155118,8/16/2017,Xavier,"Fijne plek op een superlocatie. Fijn bed, frisse kamer en een geweldige douche. Duidelijke communicatie en alles wat er nodig is is aanwezig.<br/>Wilbert is een heer van een gastheer. Absolute aanrader."
44,185360389,8/21/2017,Fatih Can,"Everything was great. Clean room, quiet neighbourhood and very close to city center. There is one thing though, stairs in the apartment were very small and there is no elevator. It might cause a problem for elderly people."
44,186758441,8/25/2017,Allan,"Wilbert lives on the ground floor and infinitely available in person at all times, a big plus. He was very accommodating of some of my personal needs while checking in and checking out."

44,191112876,9/6/2017,Wesley,"Wilbert foi muito gentil ajudando a carregar a minha mala até o 4° andar.<br/>O quarto é espaçoso e o chuveiro é fantástico!<br/>O bairro é tranquilo e próximo do transporte público, é fácil de chegar vindo da Centraal Station e também do aeroporto."
44,191560762,9/8/2017,Al,"If you're heading to Amsterdam, stay at Wilbert's place! It couldn't have been more perfect. I was on a solo trip, but I can see two people sharing the room. It's got a great shower, and a small kitchenette with a small sink. The restroom is shared and is right outside the room door. The location is a about a 15 min walk from Museum Square and the canal cruises. It's a great place to stay, I highly recommend it!"
44,192265248,9/10/2017,Vito,"Wilbert is great, the place is exactly as described. Perfect if you need a rooftop to come back to after a long day exploring Amsterdam. Very easy to get to from the airport and to reach the airport when you leave. Stairs are very steep, but that's to be expected from any house near the centre of  Amsterdam."
44,193665257,9/14/2017,Song-I,"This room is super adorable and in a neighborly location -- about a minute or two away from cute shops/restaurants, and about 10-15 minutes walking to the central locations. The bed is very comfortable and the little kitchenette was perfect to heat up leftovers and make coffee in the morning to start your day!"
44,194596120,9/17/2017,Steve,"We had an amazing time in Amsterdam.  This in part was due to the great accommodations we had. At Wilbert's.  The location is perfect with great walking and tram access to all the sights.  The room is quiet and comfortable, a perfect place to rest after a busy day.  Wilbert is a wonderful host, offering many great suggestions.  We highly recommended these accommodations and will stay there again when we return."
44,195692026,9/20/2017,Ian,"Wonderful studio on the top floor, clean, nice shower and facilities. Plentiful natural light and fresh air from the large windows. Great neibor hood close to the park, just a few minutes from city center and still quiet and peaceful at night. Thank you Wilbert!"
44,196452923,9/23/2017,Said,"Definitivamente excelente, si hubiera más de 5 estrellas, pondría más, es un apartamento muy lindo y cómodo, en zona tranquila, a una cuadra del Tram que te lleva a la central en 3 min... 15 min caminando a la zona de bares... Wilbert fue muy atento desde mi llegada, simplemente recomiendo la estancia total y ampliamente!"
44,197352848,9/25/2017,Judy,Wilbert was an exceptional host. The apartment exceeded my expectation and the location is perfect for a stay in Amsterdam. Wilbert was great at communicating and was there when I arrived. HIGHLY recommended!!
44,197853454,9/27/2017,Ian,"Super tranquil retreat after a day’s work, or for more work. Excellent host greet and info. Lovely local area and stroll towards the main centre. Definitely on my return list."
44,198748133,9/30/2017,Daisy,"The room is exactly as in the pictures, clean and confortable, also very quiet.<br/>Also close from the tramway station. Wilbert was really nice and welcoming and easyto communicate with.<br/>It's quite small, as a guestroom, felt like a student again :)<br/>Only thing is that there is no real bathroom : you actualy are in the room when you go out of the shower, so it's better for couples or very close friends !<br/>Overall it's as described, but a bit expensive for a room with shared toilets in my opinion. Might be the case in general in Amsterdam though !"
44,199567376,10/2/2017,Yao,Good place to stay.
44,200454970,10/5/2017,Shan,"房东非常热情好客,房间也很棒"
44,201895923,10/9/2017,Bj,Just outside of Amsterdam central so it’s a 30-45 minutes walk to the Center but closer to the museums. <br/><br/>You need to be fit to climb steep stairs on the 4th floor. <br/><br/>Highly recommended as host was very pleasant.
44,202381422,10/11/2017,Craig,"Wilbert's room is situated in a fantastic part of central Amsterdam, a short walk from the museum quarter and Vondelpark. The neighborhood is beautiful, with cafes and restaurants sprinkled around the vicinity of the apartment.<br/><br/>The room is spacious and well appointed. The shower is very modern and built into the room like a mini-ensuite. The bathroom is just outside the room and also clearly quite new. <br/><br/>Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my short stay at Wilbert's. Amsterdam was a highlight for me in my European travels, and Wilbert's apartment was a great base to explore the city from."
44,203463201,10/15/2017,Ben,"Wilbert is a very friendly host and keen to help he is also great with  communication. The property is well located, very clean and offers great facilities."
44,204465867,10/18/2017,Dave,"When I first found Wilbert's place I was disappointed it wasn't as close to the center as I thought. I quickly realized that this is a great thing! There is nothing in the center that Wilbert's neighborhood doesn't have. Restaurants, clubs, coffeeshops, etc, it's all there. But unlike the center, it's a relatively peaceful place that has a lot of hipness to it. You will still see tourists of course, but not even half as much as the center. Add to that it's near Vondel Park and you have a winner! As other people have said, Wilbert is a very chill and kind host. I highly recommend his place and hope to return some day."
44,205979578,10/23/2017,Mouktika,"I really enjoyed staying here. The place was clean, it was great having my own shower, and the tram was close and made the rest of Amsterdam accessible. A bit of a warning- you have to climb up a lengthy flight of those famous narrow Dutch staircases, but that just added to the experience and made it feel like I got my own cozy place. Would recommend!"
44,207430207,10/29/2017,Sam,"Au sommet d'un immeuble particulier, vous profiterez des joies de cette ""garçonnière"" parfaitement équipée pour un séjour seul ou à deux. Le quartier est calme. La proximité du tramway et du célèbre ""Vondelpark"" appréciable! La réactivité de Wilbert, un plus! Une adresse recommandable."
44,208828891,11/3/2017,Oriana,"The room at Wilbert’s place is almost like it’s own studio apartment. It is on the 5th floor and you have a private entrance so you are not walking through anyone’s house to get to your room. The room was clean and well equipped with a microwave, dishes, and utensils. Wilbert was easy is get in contact with and available if we needed anything. Finally, we really enjoyed the location. It’s just a block from the tram and two blocks from the park. There are lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Wilbert!"
44,209863863,11/6/2017,Viswanath,"Wilbert was a great host. He was very welcoming, gave plenty of tips around things to do, and was very hospitable. The place is sparkling clean and really well maintained. It's right next to a tram stop, and is just a short ride away to all the canals."
44,210776064,11/11/2017,Andrey,"Wilbert is a great host. The room was very clean and warm and comfortable. The shower in the room is awesome. It also has a quiet fridge and a microwave oven. The room is in the fourth floor and has charming wooden stairs that lead into it. The location is very quiet, this is important for a good night sleep. The overall impressions are great. Highly recommended!"
44,211558941,11/13/2017,Joe,"The room is very nice. The private shower is spacious, and the amenities clean. The best by park is great for a stroll, in the quiet neighbourhood, but is still close to transport and restaurants.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
44,212146486,11/16/2017,Anna Liya,"Wilbert is the greatest host. He will give you your space after the check in and he is very responsive at the same time. He even allowed me to stay for longer since the room was not booked the day after. I had a great experience, thank you Wilbert!"
44,212848162,11/19/2017,Melanie,"Très bonne communication avec Wilbert. Le logement est super bien équipé. On est bien au chaud et on y dort bien. La douche est super design et spacieuse.<br/>Parfait pour y rester plusieurs jours avec la kitchenette si on s'en fiche de partager les toilettes avec une autre chambre.<br/>(Notez que comme dans tous les bâtiments à Amsterdam, les escaliers sont très raides donc compliqué avec des gros bagages :))"
44,214531136,11/26/2017,Nicole,"Wilbert ist ein sehr netter und aufmerksamer Gastgeber. Die Kommunikation war immer bestens. Ich hatte Probleme beim Flug und kam um Stunden verspätet an. Wilbert ist sehr hilfsbereit, immer erreichbar und die Wohnung toll.<br/>Herzlichen Dank"

44,224831227,1/4/2018,Regis,Calm neighbourhood but a bit far from downtown
44,227250303,1/14/2018,Florian,"Wilbert is a great host, taking much pride in his beautiful house and the hospitality he provides to his guests. We were greeted and shown our room, which is very nicely appointed, clean and comfortable. Everything worked perfectly and we particularly enjoyed the luxurious shower! Will definitely be back!"
44,229186869,1/22/2018,Kevin,"Great experience - smooth check-in, clean facilities, great neighborhood, really the whole package (especially for the price)."
44,230145480,1/27/2018,Dave,This was my first trip to Amsterdam and I couldn’t have had a better experience. Wilbert was extremely helpful and welcoming. The location is just outside of the Canal Zone. But the tram is just a few blocks away and easy to use. I look forward to staying here again on my next trip to this great city!
44,230858261,1/29/2018,Sara,"amazing room, clean in a good area of Amsterdam. Quiet street and 5 minutes walking distance from the centre."
44,231855280,2/3/2018,Pedro,"This a really cool place with great cost/benefit. Wilbert is an excellent host, very available, kind and attentive.

The independent entrance is also a plus."
44,233328928,2/9/2018,재복,가까운공원옆에 위치하고 있어 고흐미술관외 다양한 시설까지 모두 걸어다닐수 있는 좋은위치. 트램등 교통시설의 편리함. 호스트의 세심한배려로 훌륭하다고 평가됩니다.
44,234792826,2/14/2018,Pauline,"Wilbert  est adorable et très accueillant , son appartement est simple et pratique, et très bien situé, juste à côté du Vondelpark. je recommande sans hésiter."
44,235595064,2/17/2018,Yves,"Het is een prima plek om Amsterdam te verkennen, niet alleen de grachtengordel, ook het bijzondere Amsterdam oud zuid enz... Het Vondelpark nabij is ideaal voor een ontbijt of een lekker rondje joggen. <br/>De kamer zelf is heel licht, de douche is zeer aangenaam. Er is een ijskast, een koffiezet, een oven...prima zo moet je niet altijd buiten eten. Het interieur mag voor mij wat gezelliger, maar dat is persoonlijk. Tot slot, een flexibele gastheer en een goede prijs-kwaliteitverhouding."
44,237545663,2/23/2018,Karen,This cosy flat was perfect and in proximity to Vondelpark and Museum District as well as situated in a fun and friendly family focused neighborhood.<br/><br/>Wilbert was very helpful in communication and in coordinating our initial meeting for receipt of the key. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend Wilbert’s flat when traveling to Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Thank you Wilbert.

44,253082541,4/13/2018,Natasha,"Wilbert was a very nice host and gave us a warm welcome to Amsterdam. Large room, plenty of storage and the little kitchen had everything we needed.

Le propriétaire  très sympathique  , vous donnera des idées sur votre séjour .  WC  très propre sur le pallier à partager avec une autre chambre au même étage . La douche (magnifique)  est dans la chambre . Bonne adresse à 15 minutes du centre avec le tram - 1 -  ( station  à 5 minutes de marche de l'appartement  )."
44,262563487,5/9/2018,Dinesh,Wilberts place is really nice and clean. A bit far away from the really central areas but the tram is just opposite so not too much of an issue. You do have to climb 5 very steep Flight of stairs with your luggage haha.
44,264116862,5/13/2018,Federica,"La stanza era accogliente, spaziosa e funzionale con doccia grande privata in camera. Il bagno era condiviso con l’altra stanza ma, pur se piccolo, sempre pulito. La posizione dell’appartamento era in una posizione comoda, vicino a fermate delle linee dei tram che collegano con il centro. Wilbert, il proprietario, è molto gentile e disponibile. <br/>La stanza di trova al 4 piano di un palazzo tradizionale olandese, quindi ha le scale molto piccole e ripide; priva di ascensore, quindi un po’ scomoda la salita dei bagagli. <br/>Nel complesso, la consiglio volentieri."
44,265156523,5/16/2018,Luiza,"Wilbert is an excellent host and his guest room is very comfortable, with a wonderful location!"
44,267058148,5/21/2018,Angela,"Wilbert heeft ons uitstekend geholpen voor en tijdens ons verblijf in Amsterdam. Voor we vertrokken hadden we enkele vragen over het parkeren, hij heeft ons meteen geholpen en suggesties doorgestuurd van locaties waar we eventueel konden parkeren. De communicatie zat ook heel goed, voor ons verblijf informeerde hij wanneer we ongeveer aankwamen. Normaal moesten we inchecken om 14 uur, maar omdat we vroeger waren dan verwacht konden we vroeger inchecken. <br/>De kamer was voorzien van een keukentje wat een pluspunt is. We hadden de nodige privacy, maar we moesten het toilet delen met een andere kamer. Op zich was dit geen probleem, want het toilet zag er telkens ook heel proper uit. Gelukkig is de kamer voorzien van een luxe douche zoals in een 5-sterrenhotel."
44,269958623,5/28/2018,Aneliya,"Amazing host, veryfriendly and helpful. The place is also really nice and clean. Great location, very close to both the airport and city centre!"
44,271027190,5/31/2018,Nadean,"Very happy with the location and the accommodation,  just as described.  Would definitely stay at Wilbert’s again!"
44,273123522,6/5/2018,Romeo,"Wilbert is a very kind person and the room is excelent! Easy access to the center and / or transportation, or even walking if desired."
44,274110792,6/8/2018,Nga,"Lovely room which is actually quite like an independant minisize appartment as it was very well equiped. The TV has the Netflix app that you can use with your own account. Two large windows so great when it's sunny. Location is perfect, near museums, the Vondelpark, the Foodhallen, and has a lot of good restaurants/bakeries/shops. I received the best welcome possible on the first day and Wilbert replies quickly beforehand. Don't miss the magnificent rose blossom around the doorway of his building!"
44,274887309,6/10/2018,François,Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Wilbert. On recommande. Accueillant et sympathique.
44,276264986,6/13/2018,Todd,Wonderful apartment and perfect location. Close to city center and tram. Very quick with responding. Would recommend!
44,277048241,6/15/2018,Lawrence,"This cozy place is in a great part of town away from the hustle and bustle of the center, but not too far away to make it a hassle. Wilbert was a great communicator and made sure I was all taken care of during my stay. Check-in was very quick and simple! I would definitely stay at this location again. "
44,280511930,6/23/2018,Phil,"Wilbert’s place was a perfect base for exploring Amsterdam. The neighborhood was really cozy and quiet, and it was a short walk to the museums and the canal district. The bed was really comfortable, the shower was luxurious, and the little kitchenette with fresh coffee was a nice touch. I would happily stay here again."
44,281549279,6/25/2018,Emmi,"The apartment was very good choice and well located. It was close to everything, about 15mins walk to the city and the neighbourhood was so pretty. Wilbert was an amazing host, everything went very well. I highly recommend this apartment! "
44,284161684,7/1/2018,Carlos,
44,285939289,7/5/2018,Olivia,"All around Wilbert’s air BNB was great!! The place was as described, the shower was a game changer and the room was clean and cozy. The stairs were also described as how steep they were but definitely were a little struggle in the evening, but when we arrived Wilbert did help me with my suitcase which was very considerate. <br/>Thank you again for a great stay!!"
44,287404627,7/8/2018,Anna,"This is a great location, close to a park, restaurants, and public transportation.  Wilbert is a great host. He is very quick to respond to your questions.  I had a nice stay."
44,288704307,7/10/2018,Marcela,"Ótima hospitalidade e bem localizado. Mas para quem não gosta de subir escadas, está não é uma boa opção; pois o quarto fica no quarto andar de um prédio com escadas bastante inclinadas e estreitas. Esse é o único ponto negativo que eu destacaria. No mais, excelente acomodação."
44,295350405,7/23/2018,Nicola,"The apartment is very lovely, comfortable, clean, well-equipped, and quiet. The neighbourhood is colorful and well connected to a tram and many interesting locations. Wilbert was a very friendly and helpful host. I would come back any time."
44,300371273,8/2/2018,Chris,"Love Wilbert’s place! Very good location, nice shower inside room and very clean overall. Great place, highly recommend!"
44,302146666,8/5/2018,Thomas,"Wilbert is a great host. The communication was very easy and he replied very quickly. The arrival was easy and he is a super friendly host who takes his time to explain everything. The room was as described, very clean and very quiet. <br/>Thanks a lot for the great time in Amsterdam. "
44,304860693,8/10/2018,Scott,"Great location and great hospitality. Wilbert was the perfect host. He allowed me to checkin early and helped me with my (50 lb!) luggage. Perfect location - close in but not too close. Away from the throngs of tourists in a neighborhood that feels like regular Amsterdamians live there. Walking distance to lots of restaurants, shops, food stores and the beautiful PARK! Definitely recommend. "
44,306061124,8/12/2018,Svenja,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei Wilbert! Die Bilder und Angaben des Zimmers stimmen genau mit dem überein, was beschrieben ist. Es war alles sehr sauber und Bad und Dusche sind sehr modern. Die Unterkunft ist in einer sehr schönen, ruhigen Wohngegend gelegen. Man kommt fußläufig gut ins Zentrum, kann aber auch die Tram-Linie 11 nutzen, die fast vor der Haustür abfährt, um zum Zentrum zu gelangen. In der Nachbarschaft gibt es einige schöne Cafés und Restaurants. <br/>Wilbert ist ein toller Gastgeber. Er war stets gut erreichbar und hat auf all unsere Nachrichten schnell geantwortet. Er hat uns auch gute Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt gegeben.<br/>Wir können das Zimmer also wirklich empfehlen!"
44,310019805,8/19/2018,Brooke,"Wilbert was a fantastic and very welcoming host! He was very informative and helpful and  I would happily recommend staying here - it's located in a fabulously convenient location, is very clean and the shower was brilliant. The small kitchen area was also perfect for making a quick snack or a meal, and the bed was also very comfortable. The four flights of stairs are steep (which is expected) but not a problem and they can provide a great workout after eating one too many Stroopwaffles haha. Staying at Wilberts was a very positive experience and I hope to book again very soon! (I also manged to pet his adorable fluffy cat which is another bonus in my book!)"
44,314684893,8/27/2018,Carla,All good
44,315673520,8/29/2018,Carla,"Wilbert is a very available host, and a good communicator. <br/>The neighborhood is very attractive and beautiful: you are amongst the true Amsterdammers, away from the mad tourist crowds. Yet only a pleasant walk to the Wilhelmina Cafe, my favorite, and the Vondel Park, the Museum Plein, and other little gems you have to find for yourself.<br/>There is plenty of room for 1 or 2 guests; great light from the 2 big windows; sweet hushed sounds from the kids and families living near you; a luxureous shower; and a power plug converter, thoughtful!"
44,319814630,9/7/2018,Malcolm,"Wilbert is the perfect Super Host. Was there to meet you as promised and went through everything personally. The apartment was fantastic and being in a suburban setting was so quiet with windows overlooking a heavily treed seeting. Transport, cafes and beautiful walks were all at your doorstep. Not that I was looking for anything to fault, but I really could not fault this fantastic property."
44,320805303,9/9/2018,Helen,They house is located in a great neighbourhood with easy access to excellent transport links.
44,322062966,9/12/2018,Eugene,"The description of the place is precise. Good location, easy check-in and check-out, friendly host. The only minus is that sound isolation between rooms inside the building is weak. Can recommend for a short stay in Amsterdam."
44,325269838,9/19/2018,Michelle,"Wilbert's place has high marks and there's a reason for that. Not only does the apartment have everything, but it's close to the city without being on top of it and inundated by tourists, it's close to a few of the tram stops that get you to Central Station in less than 20 minutes, the neighborhood is quiet, and there are 2 grocery stores within walking distance. Additionally, Wilbert is a fantastic communicator and will keep you informed of anything that happens and is open to help you out with anything you may need. I spent a little more than a week at his place and would absolutely not hesitate to stay there again in the future."
44,358350489,12/14/2018,Jim,Wilbert was a wonderful host with excellent local information. The location itself was quite central with many nearby shops and restaurants.
44,361293410,12/23/2018,Manon,"I lived in Amsterdam for 10 years and definitely my favourite area to stay in. Wilberts place is super clean, communication was super smooth and the place had really everything I needed for a pleasant stay."
44,364137274,12/30/2018,Phileas,Super chambre bien place à côté du centre ! Wilbert est super accueillant et toujours disponible. Il faut juste faire attention dans les escaliers très raides. Je recommande
44,365343073,1/1/2019,Thales,The apartment is great. It is fully equipped and it’s ideal for two people. Wilbert was really helpful and kind during our stay. I strongly recommend the apartment!
44,366697346,1/3/2019,Pavel,"Wilbert is a wonderful host. Thorough, helpful, and responsive.  The location is really wonderful in my opinion. Take your time with the stairs ;)"
44,367572500,1/5/2019,Maurelle,"Super host is a word not enough to describe Wilbert. He is always there giving a extra hand when you need him. Wilbert is very friendly and kind. <br/><br/>His place is superb! Clean, comfortable bed and pillow, and very accessible to all the sightseeing places in Amsterdam.  <br/><br/>I highly recommend staying with him."
44,401323018,1/14/2019,Rachel,Wilbert is a great host. Very warm and helpful. Check in and check out are smooth and the place is clean and spacious. Will definitely stay again.
44,401831839,1/16/2019,Ben,"Spacious place in a lovely residential street near Vondepark, quiet and close enough to walk everywhere. Wilbert is a lovely host with excellent communication. A great place to stay in Amsterdam!"
44,403091346,1/20/2019,Léa,Gamechanger (plus-value in french) : the italian shower <br/>Already was perfect
44,407892176,2/3/2019,Agathe,"Wilbert is a great host! available, even late, really helpful (especially with the luggage!), very responsive and really welcoming. The room is on the top floor (be careful the steep stairs) quiet and extremely clean. I do recommend :-) thank you Wilbert"
44,409627164,2/8/2019,Martin,Great and helpful host as well as clean location. Would definitely stay here again.
44,411069361,2/11/2019,Vitor,Wilbert's house is close to the Amsterdam Central Station (3km) and most of the Museums. The localization is perfect. <br/><br/>The room is pretty good and that's nothing to complain. Wilbert always tries to help you as soon as he can (he did that when I lost his keys and we made a deal).  <br/><br/>Strongly suggest Wilbert's accommodation.
44,413311264,2/17/2019,Ricardo,"The location is excellent, if you want to experience how locals live you should definetly stay at Wilberts apartament, Vondelpark is just 5 minutes away, a lot of food and dining places are nearby. <br/><br/>It’s situated in westside Ámsterdam which is nice because there are not a lot of tourist in the area, a 15 minute walk through Vondelpark will get you to the Rijksmuseum.<br/><br/>I would recommend  Wilbert apartament always, but specially if you are traveling with your couple. <br/><br/>A great experience."
44,414592099,2/20/2019,Alex,"The flat was spacious and well laid out and very clean with kitchenette and shower cubicle. Good hot shower with lots of room and a really comfortable bed. Peaceful area, less than 10 mins walk to trams and shops. Wilbert was kind and informative and I’m sure I could have asked him for help at any point. It is up 4 flights of steep stairs which I didn’t mind but some people might  - though Wilbert did offer to carry my luggage so I’m sure would help anyone who needed it."
44,416166892,2/24/2019,Nicolas,Very good place and Wilbert is a great host!
44,421776959,3/10/2019,Ellie,"Wilbert's place was very nice! Very close to a tram to get into the centre, lots of wonderful shops/restaurants around. The place was clean and nice and Wilbert was very accommodating."
44,423474816,3/14/2019,Bernardo,"Wilbert’s place is very stylish, cosy and convenient. Just a few minutes walking to the city center and close to delicious restaurants."
44,425480154,3/18/2019,Sandrine,J'ai passé un très bon séjour chez Wilbert.  Le logement est très bien conçu et au calme. La proximité du parc et des musées est vraiment  appréciable. Wilbert est un hôte très agréable et attentionné.  Je recommande donc vivement cette adresse.
44,426519357,3/21/2019,Annie,Wilbert's place is in the perfect location for exploring Amsterdam and has a nice private space with everything you need for a short stay.
44,428546347,3/25/2019,Gerben,"Prima plek om te verblijven! Heel nette, ruime, functionele kamer met alles wat je maar kunt wensen."
44,430269084,3/30/2019,Elizabeth,"Absolutely fantastic space! Such a perfectly located place to call home for my first time in Amsterdam. Wilbert is as kind as he is helpful and responsive! The location was close to tons of food, coffee, bike shops and it was amazing being so close to Vondelpark. Such a wonderful experience."
44,432557543,4/4/2019,Allison,"Wilbert is an excellent host. The room is exactly as pictured and in an excellent location. You can walk to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh in about 15 minutes. The street it’s located on is extremely quiet, but there are lots of restaurant choices nearby, as well as a supermarket. The room itself is spotless and equipped for small meals. Having a private shower was an added bonus! Overall, I felt the room was a great value for the area and a great choice."
44,434001112,4/7/2019,Kleanthis,"Great accomodation, very comfortable and cosy. Wilbert is a very friendly and kind host, communication was great! Highly recommended!"
44,435730055,4/11/2019,Lydia,"Wonderful location walkable to museums and public transportation.  Wilbert the host is so helpful taking my luggage up and down the narrow but typical Dutch staircases.<br/><br/>He has lots of suggestions for restaurants nearby. He told me about whether to take the tram or to walk to my destination.<br/><br/>I had to have a FedEx delivery from the US, he not only gave me his mailing address; he made make sure that he was home when the package was delivered. So appreciative for his thoughtfulness. However, I did plan my day so that I only come back and climb the staircases only once a day."
44,441723676,4/22/2019,Philippe,"Perfect host ! Agréable voyage grâce à wilbert . Nous le remercions encore pour cet accueil , sa disponibilité . Je conseille à tout le monde"
44,443469035,4/26/2019,April,"Wilbert was a fantastic host! He offered great recommendations for things to do and restaurants in areas outside of Amsterdam when we were staying in Santpoort-Noord before we arrived to Amsterdam. Checkin was easy and Wilbert was so accommodating with changes. He was always quick to respond to any questions we had. He is so friendly and kind, a wonderful host. His location is great 15-20minutes to city center by bus and lots of local cafes nearby.  Would recommend him to other traveling to Amsterdam and would stay here again! "
44,446777972,5/2/2019,Eduardo,"Great room with everything you need. Comfortable, quiet and clean. Perfect base to explore Amsterdam. I certainly plan to go back. Also, Wilbert is a superhost!"
44,448392748,5/5/2019,Jamie,"The location, the room itself and importantly Wilbert, the host were all more than I could have hoped for. From the communication to the room everything was timely , clean and just well done.<br/><br/>I booked the place for my parents to stay nearby my own apartment and they were ever so impressed with it all. I had great communication with Wilbert and check out was super easy.<br/><br/>5/5, definitely recommend for anyone tempted to come to Amsterdam for a weekend."
44,450020587,5/8/2019,Lauren,"Really enjoyed our time here, room was beautiful and Wilbert is a great host! Highly recommend"
44,453998374,5/17/2019,Matt,A good clean place to stay in Amsterdam. Good location walking distance to vondelpark and the museum area. Tram stop 5 minute walk away takes you centraal station and all tourist areas. The local area has plenty of local cafe/pubs and restaurants. Plenty of supermarkets as well. Excellent value for money
44,456265241,5/21/2019,Patsy,"Wonderful location, great host and as long as you don't mind the stairs that are everywhere in Europe, you will not regret booking this nice room! I was very appreciative of the host taking my luggage up to the room and down again when I checked out! I ubered to my friend's place most days in the RijksMuseum neighborhood for €6 one way (only a 15-20 minute walk)."
44,457129545,5/23/2019,Mary,"Wilbert’s home is in a lovely neighbourhood - a walk away from coffee shops, restaurants, museums,  transportation and a grocery store.  As Wilbert points out there are stairs to the top room but it is peaceful in the evening and our gracious host provided us with coffee and tea. There is a wonderful separate shower and sink. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.   Many thanks Wilbert!"
44,458631514,5/26/2019,David,"Wilbert’s place is in a charming residential area south of the city center and accessible by tram line. The home is tall and narrow, so be ready for some very steep steps up to your room. Wilbert lugged our bags up for us, and he helped me make sure my parking was properly paid for; street parking is very expensive and quite limited. Overall, we had a great experience."
44,460809818,5/30/2019,Molly,"Very clean, modern space and in a great location (quiet neighborhood with lots of food options just a few blocks away)! Wilbert was accommodating and always happy to offer reccomendations."
44,462582497,6/2/2019,Gessielli,"The location is great, you can easily walk or cycle around. The accommodation looks the same as in the pictures and the bed is very comfortable!<br/>I was expecting blinds but I believe they don’t use it much in the Netherlands. But it actually helped naturally waking up earlier than usual and enjoying the city!"
44,465710658,6/8/2019,Denise,"Wilberts place is in a great location - a peaceful street a few minutes cycle from Volderpark. Wonderful cafes, bars and canals nearby. A short cycle to the centre of Amsterdam or the tram stop is just around the corner. You can lock your bike up just outside.<br/>The room was spotlessly clean with a great private shower and shared toilet. It was brilliant to have a fridge, oven and coffee machine in the room - with complimentary coffee and tea. Wilbert is a great host - helping me with my luggage and giving tips on the local area, even checking in via email to see that everything was OK. I would highly recommend and will stop again next time I am in the city. Thanks Wilbert!"
44,467301702,6/10/2019,Frederique,Excellent communication and welcome <br/>Wilbert makes the journey easy and confortable
44,468310545,6/12/2019,Thierry,"Heel prettig contact, prima kamer op een mooie centrale locatie"
44,469660321,6/15/2019,Vincent,You can take that apartment eyes closed. It is just perfect. Once arrived you can obviously re-open your eyes to appreciate its quality! Wilbert will guide you through all the details. He is very kind. I strongly recommend his apartment. Just awesome!
44,471303789,6/17/2019,Rosana,It is a single room but very well equipped! Wilbert designed it (himself) to be self sufficient (with the exception of the toilet-which is shared). Wilbert is extremely fast in responding and quick to offer assistance in any way. He got the place cleaned up in a very short turnaround given that my flight would get in well before the official check-in time. The location is walking distance from all points of interest and the neighborhood has all the quintessential Amsterdam charm. I highly recommend this listing!
44,472183579,6/19/2019,Maila,"Foi uma ótima estadia, coerente com as informações e fomos muito bem recebidos pelo Wilbert. Além disso, está bem localizada. Recomendo esse lugar para uma boa viagem em Amsterdã!"
44,473189837,6/21/2019,Vu,"Such a great find! If I ever go back to Amsterdam I don’t think I would want to stay anywhere else. <br/>Wilbert is such an attentive host, he’s been so flexible with check in and just great with answering my questions right away.<br/>So about his place, it’s a fourth floor walk up with a private shower in the room, the toilet is shared with just one other room. <br/>The apartment is located near the tram and the museum area, I walked to the Van Gogh museum and it probably took me      about 15 minutes to get there.<br/>Overall, I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Wilbert!"
44,475499123,6/24/2019,Lucy,We enjoyed our stay at Wilbert’s place very much. He was a helpful host and the apartment is very cute and has everything we needed for our stay. We loved the nearby restaurants and cafes and it was lovely to be so close to Vondelpark. I’d definitely recommend for anyone passing through Amsterdam!
44,477924151,6/29/2019,Aline,"I can only recommend this room, Wilbert was very forthcoming and gave good tips. The location is perfect, by foot only about 15min from leidsplain and just across the street of the lovely vondelpark. I will definately go again, lovely city."
44,481138830,7/4/2019,Kobie,"The accommodation was clean. Clear instructions were given, help if needed and good coffee! Ticked all the boxes for me."
44,486706798,7/13/2019,Leslie,"L’appartement est très bien placée, près du Vondelpark, à quelques mètres du tram, restaurants et commerces. Wilbert a été d’une très grande gentillesse. Je recommande sans hésiter! Merci pour tout Wilbert!!"
44,488702732,7/15/2019,Yibing,"Wilbert is a warm hearted host who is very responsive and helpful before, during and after my whole stay. The room is located in quiet and lovely neighborhood with convenient access to the museums and transportation hubs. Highly recommend!"
44,492503591,7/21/2019,Hyesu,"It was nice staying in Amsterdam. Great location, close to central yet quiet and leafy. :D Wilbert is very helpful and kind, lovely host ! There is A new korean chicken restaurant near by, delicious !:))"
44,493805065,7/23/2019,Natalia,Excelente
44,499959089,8/1/2019,Kyle,really lovely modern place in a great location. Wilbert was really helpful and a great host.
44,504689959,8/8/2019,Oleksandr,"I think this is the best AirBnB stay I've had so far. Great place with true local vibe, nice location, quiet apartment, comfy bed and all the amenities you need. Mr. Wilbert was very welcoming, thoughtful and gave me plenty of recommendations on public transport, local cafes and restaurants and so on. There were some nice thoughtful touches like a travel adapter for electric outlet etc. I highly recommend this place!"
44,508128148,8/12/2019,Raymond,Wonderful location not far from central Amsterdam. The host was also very accommodating in every way. Would highly recommend!
44,509347615,8/14/2019,Corey,"Wilberts place was great. Close to trams and busses to get around even tho I walked most places, 20 min walk to a lot of popular attractions. Lots of cafes, Coffeeshops, and food options close by."
44,510511416,8/16/2019,Lisamarie,"The place is in a good location . Wilbert was an outstanding host , and the bed is super comfy."
44,512244442,8/18/2019,Jieun,"Wilbert is a really nice guy. Everything was the same as its description. I didn't have time to plan much for the trip because it was a business trip, but I was lucky because the location of BnB was so good to go anywhere spontaneously. I love to visit again."
44,515519718,8/23/2019,Marie-Christine,Great stay!
44,517007161,8/25/2019,Sara,"Wilbert was an amazing host! The guestroom was very clean, cosy and had a nice view. It had a really nice location as well! Recommend it to everyone!"
44,518789650,8/27/2019,Danielle,"We loved our stay here! Wilbert was a great host, and answered all communications, both before and during the trip quickly. He was able to recommend a great dinner place nearby that was out of the main tourist area, that you could tell was more of a local hangout. The room was super cute, and had everything we needed and more. We would definitely both recommend this to anyone visiting."
44,520999726,8/31/2019,Kim,Wilbert house was clean and comfortable! I highly recommend this house.
44,523720177,9/4/2019,John,"One of the best airbnb's I've ever stayed in. As long as you're okay climbing stairs, this place is a gem and well worth checking out. Wilbert was a very responsive, kind, helpful, and interesting host. When I return to Amsterdam, I surely try to stay here again."
44,527211591,9/10/2019,Trisha,"Excellent location for evening walks in the park.  Many choices for budget eating places.  Close to public transportation.  Very simple kitchenette, not for dinner preparations. 4 flights of stairs up to the room on the top floor.  Shared toilet."
44,527964552,9/12/2019,Danis,Probably the best value for money you can find in Amsterdam. Basically it's almost like an apartment - you'll have a personal shower but will share a bathroom with another room. Though probably you won't ever meet people you sharing a bathroom with.<br/>And coffee machine was very helpful.
44,530781039,9/16/2019,Mimi,"Wilbert’s accommodation is so comfortable and convenient (near central about 15-20mins by tram).And Wilbert is a kind host,he gives us a great experience.I trust it’s the best Amsterdam Airbnb!"
44,531845022,9/18/2019,Francesca,"Lo studio è semplicemente perfetto per un soggiorno di breve durata: pulitissimo, ben ammobiliato, luminoso, tranquillo, a 10 minuti di tram dalla stazione centrale e a 30 minuti dall'aeroporto (con i mezzi pubblici). Il quartiere West, dove si situa, ospita innumerevoli ristorantini, locali e negozi di alimentari. L'accoglienza di Wilbert è molto simpatica e calorosa. Lo raccomando!"
44,534765429,9/23/2019,Anne,"We thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to Amsterdam.  Wilbert, our host, was gracious and thoughtful even offering to bring our suitcases up and down for us.  <br/>    For any first time visitor, be aware that most residences in Amsterdam are built with narrow staircases and steep steps so as to maximize living space.  Absolutely great for muscle toning, but don’t overpack your suitcase!<br/>    Our 4th floor room was clean, comfortable and bright.  It became our refuge each evening after exploring on foot the city’s many museum gems.<br/>    It was a great place for us to stay with it’s many local restaurants and convenient grocery store. We would definitely stay here again.<br/>   Thank you Wilbert for being a terrific ambassador for the Dutch people."
44,538826112,9/30/2019,Nathan C,"Nice location out of the busy area. Super easy to get to and from in the tram. Bed is just two singles pushed together so not the most comfy, but over a really nice place. Simple and efficient."
44,543750358,10/8/2019,Caitlin,"My mom and I stayed here for two nights while exploring Amsterdam and we loved it. It was very close to public transport, making it easy to get around the city. Wilbert was very accommodating and helpful with suggestions of things to do and see. The room was clean and had great amenities. We loved the area of Amsterdam that Wilbert’s place was located. It was quaint and was close to restaurants and shops."
44,544970936,10/11/2019,Madhu,Great central location with easy check in/check out process.
44,546859113,10/14/2019,Yaman,Great amenities. Clean room with private shower. Shared bathroom is very clean.
44,547922212,10/16/2019,John,"Wilbert's place is better than I expected. The photos don't do it justice and the area is great. Specifically, the large rain shower was fantastic.<br/><br/>My only caution is that if you have large luggage, or have trouble with stairs, the room I had at the top is probably not best suited to you. But if you travel light, it's perfect."
44,549526559,10/18/2019,Ramona,"I had a brilliant stay at Wilbert's place. He was very welcoming and reliable,the Apartment was super clean and modern. The neighbourhood is very quiet, yet close to the center. I felt absolutely  safe and at home with this accomodation. Five stars *****"
44,553128459,10/23/2019,さくら,とても信頼できるﾎｽﾄです｡部屋は狭い階段を上がった一番上にありますが､ﾎｽﾄが行き帰りともに手伝ってくれました｡<br/>徒歩三分程度でﾄﾗﾑの駅があり､市街地にも簡単にｱｸｾｽできます｡部屋は清潔感があり､綺麗に整えられていました｡<br/>また､閑静な住宅地なのでとても静かでした｡同じような建物が沢山あるので､ (Hidden by Airbnb) ﾏｯﾌﾟで､どの建物か覚えておくのがおすすめです｡<br/>ﾎｽﾄの方は､とても気配りをしてくれて問題ないか気にかけてくれていました｡おすすめです!
44,554958237,10/27/2019,Daniel,"Great place - central, but quiet, and a quick trip from the airport and/or central train station. Everything you need close by, including shops, restaurants, bars. Small, but comfortable and very clean place. <br/>Just mind the steps - like most places in Amsterdam this place comes with a steep and narrow staircase. <br/>A highly recommendable place - nothing to criticize. We‘ll be back."
44,560918220,11/8/2019,Naomi,Wilberts private room is a great if you are looking to be near the the magical Vondelpark and a a cozy modern apartment! Really has all you need for a pleasant stay and Wilbert is super nice and helpful! Thanks again 
44,563595385,11/13/2019,Taylor,If you are wanting a place that is local and and relaxing then you must stay with Wilbert! He has a lot of knowledge about the area and all the local hot spots that are close by! I throughly enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be back!!
44,564588557,11/16/2019,Alexandra,"Wonderful stay! The area was wonderful; tons of restaurants and bars while not being in the busy city center. Lots going on but street was quiet at night. The steps are STEEP! And there are a lot of them. But Wilbert offered graciously to carry my bags up the stairs and check-in and down at check-out. The room is very basic, but everything you need including cups for coffee, tea, and water. Never had an issue with the toilet-share, and had a great sink and personal shower in the room. The shower is a ""game-changer"", as Wilbert put it. As long as you're okay with stairs, I would highly recommend!"
44,565944881,11/18/2019,Fabiana,Great apartment and location! Shower is the best feature :)
44,568253770,11/24/2019,Jean-Marc,Definitely recommend Wilbert's place. Everything was great from his directions to check-in to availability to hospitality.
44,570359807,11/29/2019,Vanessa,"This is a wonderful place to stay! Wilbert was kind, accommodating, and helpful. The apartment is in a great location, close to the park and museums and easily accessible via public transportation. <br/>You do have to climb many stairs to get to the apartment, and the bathroom is shared with the other unit on that floor, but it’s still a great value and I’d happily stay here again!"
44,571593329,12/1/2019,Andrew,Clean apartment close to vondal park. Steep stairs to fourth floor only drawback but that’s Amsterdam houses. A good Airbnb
44,573873856,12/7/2019,Vanessa,"Wilbert is a Superhost simply because he carries your luggage up and down the 4 steep flights of stairs! No elevator, and don’t get too tipsy when you use the stairs. But the space is great, roomy, light, good amenities, in a fun neighborhood and close to sights and transportation. Besides carrying luggage,Wilbert responds quickly and is very welcoming."
44,576012273,12/12/2019,Monica,"Clean, cozy and convenient! Loved my stay at Wilbert’s place.  Everything was exactly as described/as shown in the photos.  The location is great, easy to get around town by tram and walking or Uber.  Wilbert is a wonderful host and was always very quick to reply to any message I sent him.  Would definitely recommend staying here!"
44,577226565,12/15/2019,Ahmet,"This is amazing value for your money. It's basically a studio, even though it's published as a room. I had my own entrance, my own kitchenette, my own shower, and many thoughtful touches that had available most of what you'd need during stay (ironing (if i remember correctly), cleaning, umbrella, plenty of cabinets, etc). You will only share a (very clean) toilet with another airbnb 'studio' if it happens to be booked."
44,583752210,12/29/2019,Marina,"That was perfect place to stay . Nice and clean apartment,  location first looked like a bit far but really you can find everything you need around the place. Host friendly and helpful. Would recommend 100%"
44,586728420,1/2/2020,Katia,"Wonderful apartment! Great location in a cool neighborhood, we walked everywhere almost always! We recommend going to the Spar grocery store if you want tonpay by credit card that's visa or MasterCard since alber heijn don't accept thos(!).Very comfortable and stylish.keep in mind that the stairs are a bit challenging to climb.And, the bathroom on the 4th floor for room number 2 and the other room on that floor is shared between the two,we personally had no problems with it, didn't see the guests from the other room at all.All in all, great Airbnb and host :)"
44,588878959,1/5/2020,Phillip,"Though there are a few flights of stairs, Wilbert’s cozy apartment is the perfect spot and location to experience what Amsterdam has to offer. Excellent WiFi for those traveling without cell service, great shower in room, shared toilet in the hall, door code to get into your room, so you don’t forget to lock and stress out, and nearby to most attractions and a stone’s throw from the beautiful Vondelpark. Wilbert is extremely responsive to messages and more accommodating than any other host Ive experienced through AirBnB."
44,590347221,1/8/2020,Mauricio,"Wilbert é um excelente anfitrião, nos recebeu na porta, ajudou com as malas para subir as escadas, explicou tudo sobre o quarto, nos deixou um café extraordinário !<br/>Responde as mensagens em poucos minutos; nossa primeira experiência com o Airbnb foi excelente graças a este grande anfitrião.<br/>Recomendamos !"
44,594829054,1/19/2020,Constanze,"Wonderful place, very well connected, a spatious light room with enough space to combine city travelling and work. And really an amazing price for Amsterdam accomodations! We will definitely come back"
44,600758522,2/2/2020,Natalia,"The room was perfect and cozy. It‘s amazing to have such a nice shower in the apartment and everything was super clean. During my stay there were no other guests in the room next door, so I didn‘t have to share the toilet. I had everything to myself. <br/>I can only reccomend Wilberts room. He is a very polite and friendly host. I‘d go there anytime again."
44,603475525,2/9/2020,Mike,"Exactly as shown in the pictures. Very clean and perfect space for what I needed. Wilbert was very friendly and great with communication. Would definitely return to stay there again in the future, thank you!!"
44,605684441,2/15/2020,Elis,"Wilbert is such a nice, friendly and helpful host. Everything was so nice during my stay. The room, shower, and shared bathroom were so clean. The photos are actual. The bed was not as good as I expected, but also not so bad. Wilbert was so kind and thoughtful to offer me carrying my luggage both arriving and leaving. I would prefer the room one more time, for my next trip to Amsterdam."
44,607133331,2/17/2020,Brandon,Great air bnb with a perfect location. Walking distance or a short tram ride to all of what Amsterdam has to offer! Many great cafes and restaurants near by and Wilbert was a perfect Host.

44,615126507,3/7/2020,Philly,"Great stay at this accommodation- the room was very modern, stylish and clean. There was provision of excellent fresh coffee and tea, a smart tv (including UK channels and Netflix), wonderful shower and a comfortable bed. Wilbert is an excellent host, meeting guests needs as well as being very responsive on the app. Be aware, the room is up 4 flights of steep stairs so you’ll get a bit of exercise in as well!<br/>Would strongly recommend."
44,653130863,8/18/2020,Mark,"Clean, stylish and comfortable studio apartment in a great Amsterdam neighbourhood close to Vondelpark and Museumplein (Museum Square). Wilbert is a great host who couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful. Communication from booking through to during my stay was excellent and he is very quick to respond to any questions/messages on the app. When I visit Amsterdam again in the future, I would definitely stay here again."
75,17071933,8/6/2014,Dario,"We had the best time in Niki & Jan's home. The apartment is even better than it looks in the pictures: a two storey in a typical old Amsterdam building overlooking a canal, all furniture and decoration is lovely. Specially, the second floor, with a huge and beautiful kitchen and a living room (plus a terrace full of plants). On the fisrt floor, the main bedroom has a beautiful big old bathtub, the perfect way to relax after a whole day of walking through the city. <br/>Niki & Jan were the perfect hosts: apart from leaving us a personal guide for the apartment, the city and the neighborhood, they were really understanding and accommodating with some last-minute problem we had.   <br/>Oh, and the neighborhood is great too: in the historical center but just out of all the Red Light District fuss. <br/>This was maybe the most wonderful Airbnb apartment we have enjoyed. Hope we can repeat. "
75,17748322,8/17/2014,Monica,"La mia famiglia ed io abbiamo trascorso 11 giorni nella bellissima casa di Niki e Jan. L'appartamento è in una zona centrale dal quale sono facilmente raggiungibili tutte le principali attrazioni di Amsterdam. La casa è bellissima, invasa di luce e arredata con grande personalità. Essendo abitata dagli stessi proprietari durante l'anno, è completa di tutto ed è perfetta per accogliere una famiglia con bambini. Mi sarebbe piaciuto parlare greco o giapponese per poter leggere uno dei tantissimi libri di Niki! Anche se non abbiamo avuto occasione di incontrarci, mi sembra di conoscerla un po'. E' stato un soggiorno davvero piacevole. Grazie di tutto a Niki e Jan e un saluto ai loro ragazzi."
75,39603151,7/25/2015,Carmen,"La casa está situada en un calle céntrica y tranquila. Es tan bonita como se ve en las fotos. Niki da todas las facilidades para que el alojamiento sea muy cómodo y tengas todo lo que necesitas. Nos recibió Liliana, que habla español y resolvió cualquier cuestión durante nuestra estancia, incluso haciéndonos algún favor para el que no tenía obligación. El wifi va fenomenal, Niki tiene muchos dvd de películas que se pueden ver y una cocina espectacular. No hay ruidos del vecindario en ningún momento. Vistas espectaculares al canal. Gracias por todo, Niki y Liliana."
75,40909746,8/3/2015,Maria,"Our days in Amsterdam were amazing, and Nikki's house contributed a lot with that. What a lovely house full of beautiful objects. Location was perfect and everything worked very well with the adorable Liliana. Thank you so much Nikki's and family for sharing your home with US."
75,72349456,5/2/2016,Maya,"We enjoyed the stay in Niki's hous. <br/>The apartment is very authentic,  beautiful and clean.<br/>Great location.<br/>We didn't  want to leave her.<br/>Thank you very much Niki, Jan and Lilian<br/>"
75,88567923,7/24/2016,Bonnie,"We had an amazing experience in Niki's apartment. It was peaceful, light filled, and comfortable. We loved curling up with our books on the couches at the end of a long day of sightseeing. The balcony was filled with flowers and plenty of room for all of us to watch the canal traffic. It struck the right balance between local personality without making us feel as if we were intruding in someone else's space. Niki left us with with water and stroopwaffles upon our arrival and make sure her friend was there to greet us and her welcome packet gave us the info we needed. Bathroom was a little small but that is to be expected in an urban apartment. I highly recommend Niki's place, especially for a family who wants a ""home"" in Amsterdam. "
75,91283796,8/4/2016,Marc,"Nous avons passé un super séjour chez Niki à Amsterdam avec nos deux petits-enfants. L'appartement occupe les troisième et quatrième étages de l'immeuble et les escaliers sont assez raides et les marches nombreuses car les plafonds sont hauts. Le logement est spacieux, très confortable et très lumineux, très bien équipé et la vue de la terrasse est très belle sur le canal et les environs. Les couchages sont de bonne qualité et les chambres bien aménagées (avec une baignoire dans la chambre parentale !). Nous y avons vécu très à l'aise et avons appréciés que Niki laisse tout à disposition. Le logement est très bien situé dans Amsterdam, proche du centre mais vraiment au calme. A deux pas on trouve tous les commerces alimentaires (y compris bio), des bars en terrasse sympas et un marché de plein air. Pas de problème non plus pour les transports, le métro est à côté et les bus et trams pas loin, et puis il y a le vélo (en étant très vigilant !). Nous avons été très bien accueilli par Liliana, amie de Niki, qui était aussi là pour notre départ, c'est une personne très agréable, chaleureuse et sympathique  que nous n'oublierons pas."
75,92606175,8/9/2016,Thibault,"I sadly haven't the pleasure to meet Niki in person but she has been very nice and responsive to all my questions and request before the arrival.<br/>Communication was simple and easy, and our stay in her place went perfectly. The place is like on pictures, even better. Bright and sunny, spacious living room and kitchen, and lovely terrace with view on the canal.<br/>Liana welcomed us warmly and was concerned by all our questions and requests. <br/>I warmly recommend Niki's place, which is a real Airbnb : you feel at home.

75,261405268,5/6/2018,Hugh,"A beautiful place with easy access to various attractions.

I would definitely recommend Nikki’s place to anyone."
75,263129991,5/11/2018,Timo,"We Never met Niki - but she was very friendly and helpful to our questions. Her Friend helped us a lot and had an answer for every question.

Also sportliche Herausforderung, die für alte Menschen und kleine Kinder problematisch sein könnte.<br/>Reichhaltig ausgestattete Wohnung in sehr schöner zentraler und ruhiger Lage als perfekter Start für unsere täglichen Erkundungen (54 Tsd Schritte in 3 1/2  Tagen).

Von da aus stehen alle Möglichkeiten offen. <br/>Unsere Vermieterin haben wir im Vorfeld per (Hidden by Airbnb) kontaktiert und alle wichtigen Auskünfte, wie Parkmöglichkeiten, Verkehrsverbindungen,.... super gut erklärt bekommen.  Unsere Vermieterin war während unseres Aufenthaltes in Amsterdam nicht da, aber sie hat uns den Kontakt ihres ""Host"" Hamid vermittelt, der auch sehr, sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit war. Die Wohnung war perfekt - sehr groß - super sauber und was für uns neu war, es waren alle vorhandenen Lebensmittel für unsere Nutzung gedacht. Einfach traumhaft. Die Lage der Wohnung ist sehr ruhig, perfekt nach einem langen Tag in dem wunderschönen trubeligen Amsterdam.<br/>Vielen Dank, dass wir von Jet akzeptiert wurden."

84,19127218,9/7/2014,Lorenzo,"Simply put: Anita and her husband Paul are wonderful hosts, but this is just a consequence of they're being wonderful persons.<br/>Everything was perfect, from the location to the warm apartment, great for a couple like us. Surroundings have everything you may need during your stay in Amsterdam, from the bistro ideal for breakfast to the exotic cuisine, supermarkets, and a few meters from the house you will find a gorgeous and large market, full of typical Dutch products that you can even taste prior to any purchase! A short walk from the apartment you will find the tram stop, which will take you to the center in 5-10 minutes ... well, nothing is missing! <br/>The apartment itself is very comfortable, the bed is so comfy and there is a fantastic balcony, with table and chairs included, to spend some relaxing time... then the great thing is that despite all the ""life"" in the area, the house is shrouded in silence, cause the balcony (and the entire apartment) is overlooking the inner courtyard of the palace at night, so you do not hear a pin drop, you sleep divinely! <br/>What about else? Which, as mentioned in the beginning, Anita and Paul are not just hosts, but people who are open to dialogue, knowledge of different cultures and the constant feeling that they're caring about you. A small example to give a better idea: the day of departure, due to maintenance work on the railway linking Amsterdam to the airport, the trains had been suspended, so you could just catch the bus from the central station of Amsterdam that takes much longer time, thus we were risking to lose the plane. Wel,l Paul took us by car to the nearest station to the airport and from there we arrived safely in time... when I go back to the Dutch capital, I already know where I will search my accommodation!"
84,19291108,9/9/2014,Krista,"Anita is een heel lieve en vriendelijke gastvrouw ! We voelden ons zeer welkom en haar studio was perfect in orde ! Ook een heel fijne en leuke buurt, het doet me terug denken aan mijn studententijd in Leuven... . Anita is zeer attent,  en dat kan ik echt waarderen...het zit hem dikwijls in kleine dingen ! Mijn eerste kennismaking met airbnb is meteen een succes ! <br/><br/><br/>"
84,19412408,9/12/2014,Gemma,"Anita made us feel extremely welcome. The unit was absolutely perfect and we could not fault it in any way. It is located in a great area with markets in the street next to it! <br/>The studio is complete with all the little extras that make your stay so much more comfortable. At times, we didn't want to leave the apartment because it felt like home! Lucky Amsterdam has so much to see and do.. Trams are located within a short walking distance and Anita is available to and ask questions whenever you need to. Wifi works very well also.<br/>A fabulous stay! Our top air B and B location so far. Thanks for having us Anita! :)"
84,19671806,9/16/2014,India,"We had such a lovely stay! Our flight was delayed but we got in touch with Anita and although she had made plans she made sure that Paul was there to let us in and welcome us. She also gave us very helpful clear directions to the apartment. The apartment was just as it seemed in the pictures, very clean and bright. The kitchen was well equipped and bedding, towels and shower gel all included. The wifi worked perfectly and a guide book, helpful leaflets and a folder with recommendations for restaurants etc. was on the table for us. There were also a few food essentials stocked in the fridge as well as biscuits and chocolates! <br/>The apartment was slightly out of the city centre but we walked everywhere easily and it was close to a few small supermarkets and cafes. <br/>No complaints! I would recommend and stay again."
84,20085181,9/23/2014,Scott,"Anita was a wonderfully kind host and our stay in Amsterdam will always be remembered. The apartment is in a vibrant area of Amsterdam with a wonderful variety of restaurants, cafes, bars and boutique shops. The market is just a street over, which was a great place to wander around, people watch and shop. Anita's apartment was just what we like: quiet, clean, comfortable, warm and cozy, with everything we needed for the 5 days: the little balcony was great for sipping wine in the early evenings before we hit the town. Anita - especially thanks for your help with the impromptu visit of my parents, who were also visiting Amsterdam! <br/><br/><br/>"
84,20339055,9/28/2014,Mauve,"Beautiful, cosy and very clean apartment with everything you need! Great attention to details. Ideally situated in a very nice neighborhood. Thanks to Anita and her warm welcome and advices, my friends and I had a wonderful time in Amsterdam. Highly recommended!"
84,20549191,10/1/2014,Éliane,"Nous étions 3 filles et nous avons passé 3 nuits à cet appartement.  Les photos correspondent exactement à la réalité.  L'appartement est plein de charme et extrêmement propre.  Anita nous a reçu chaleureusement et nous a présenté quelques attractions du quartier.  Elle était très serviable et sympathique.  Les lits sont confortable et l'espace est suffisant pour ces quelques jours.  Le balcon donne sur une cours tranquille.  Le quartier est calme, mais il y a plusieurs bons restaurants autour.  Le centre-ville est à environ 20 minutes de marche.   Un séjour très agréable pour découvrir la ville d'Amsterdam ! "
84,20740016,10/5/2014,Melanie,"Anita war sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Zu Beginn hat sie uns gleich mehrere sehr detaillierte Wegbeschreibungen geschickt, auch die Wohnung war sehr liebevoll eingerichtet und es lagen Handtücher mit Schoki auf dem Bett und im Kühlschrank stand gekühltes Bier für uns bereit. Auch während unseres Aufenthaltes stand Anita uns mit Rat und Tat zur Seite. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und können es nur weiterempfehlen! :-)"
84,21284929,10/14/2014,Emily,"What a charming apartment this is! My husband and I stayed in Amsterdam for a few days during our European honeymoon adventure. This was the perfect choice for this city. Anita's daughter Judith was the one to greet us when we arrived and explained all about the apartment, she was also very accommodating of our rather late check in time of 10 pm due to the flight we came in on. The place is very clean and so comfortable! Felt like home, and had nearly everything we needed (there is no hair dryer...not a big problem, but a detail to note if you are packing light and not bringing one with you!). The apartment is out of the city centre but perfectly accessible by public transit and a reasonable cab ride from central station if you have luggage. There are many great restaurants and shopping right around the apartment so no need to venture very far for any of that. What really got us were all the extra little details taken into account by our gracious host; they really made a very pleasant stay quite exceptional! We strongly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Amsterdam - it's a little piece of home in a wonderfully unique city."
84,21459180,10/18/2014,Pilar,"Anita y su marido nos han tratado maravillosamente, la casa nos ha enamorado, todo ha sido excelente... Muchas gracias Anita por todo!!! Estamos muy felices!!!"
84,21778616,10/24/2014,Stephanie,"I can't recommend this place or Anita and Paul enough! They were WONDERFUL hosts! <br/><br/>First, Anita and Paul welcomed me on the first day without hesitation, and held my bags while I roamed around the city. They also checked in with me to make sure I had everything I needed and wanted! (And they're really nice, really sweet, and really interesting people!) <br/><br/>Second, the apartment is WONDERFUL! There's amazing light, it's really cozy, the bed is extremely comfortable, and there is plenty of room. The apartment had everything I needed and more -- including a full range of kitchen supplies so you can cook at home. I know one of the reviews a bit further down says there wasn't a hair dryer, but rest assured that there is now! And it's a good one! <br/><br/>Third, the apartment is in the PERFECT location. It's in a quiet area of the city, but you aren't far from anything. It's close to a tram and bus, and about a 15 minute walk to the museums or to Rembrandtplein. "
84,21940893,10/27/2014,Kerstin,"Es war perfekt! Die Unterkunft war genauso wie beschrieben, zentral, trotzdem ruhig und voller Atmosphäre, sehr gepflegt und gemütlich und besonders. Anita hat uns zuverlässig empfangen und eingewiesen, und uns auch während unseres Aufenthaltes nicht allein gelassen.<br/>Vielen Dank, Anita und Paul, wir haben uns sehr willkommen gefühlt! <br/>Auch der Kaffee bei euch war sehr nett, es war schön, euch kennen zu lernen und wir kommen gerne wieder!"
84,22290873,11/3/2014,James,"Anita was a delight  -  very friendly and amenable.  The apartment is clean, comfortable and well situated.  It is a little bit outside the crazy centre of the city and perhaps all the better for this reason, plus the Pijp has plenty to offer in terms of food, markets etc.  It is also an easy tram ride to Centraal station.  "
84,24721239,1/2/2015,Cansu D.,"I will go ahead and repeat many before me: Anita and Paul are very warm, welcoming and considerate hosts, and the space is lovely. Highly recommended! <br/><br/>Even in the dead of winter it was perfectly heated, has everything you would need. It is also very well located (never had to use public transportation during our week there), De Pijp is much more authentic than the more touristy parts of the city. <br/><br/>It was magical watching the fireworks still go hours after 00:00 on the New Year's from the little balcony, sipping the wine Anita and Paul left on the doormat for us with a lovely note - they are that nice!"
84,25305672,1/12/2015,Kerr,"Anita and Paul were two of the nicest people we've had the pleasure of interacting with. Made us feel welcome from the minute we arrived, with lots of information about the apartment and surrounding amenities. Great WiFi, absolutely no problems streaming Netflix etc. Apartment is very clean and has great character. Comfy bed with extra blankets - not that we needed them as the heating system is great and has a controllable thermostat. Anita responded within minutes if we had any issues which made our holiday stress free. Had the pleasure of having coffee with Anita and Paul which was a great touch to gain an insight to their lives. De Pijp is a nice area with lots of bars and little restaurants - you never have to walk far to find what you're looking for. All in all a great experience and would definitely recommend. "
84,25493293,1/18/2015,Batya,"There are no words to describe just how lovely this little rental is!!! Not only is the actual space beautiful, cozy and clean but the hosts, Anita and Paul, are the nicest, kindest hosts we have ever met. They went above and beyond to help us with anything we needed and made us feel so welcome. We will definitely return to this charming vacation spot again!! We cannot recommend them enough. Thank you both for enhancing our trip!"
84,25707238,1/24/2015,Or,"Our visit was perfect. Me and my friends came for a week's stay, and it was amazing. Beautiful apartment with everything from a WiFi connection, dishes, countless books and magazines, beautiful view, to automatic heating for the cold winter days. The apartment is located in a great location; we managed to get anywhere we needed by foot. But the most pleasant part was Paul and Anita. Really amazing and interesting people. We were given a very warm welcome by them, and all through our stay they answered all of our questions and gave us alot of helpful recommendations about what to do in and outside Amsterdam. We also had coffee with them one morning and got to know each other, which was really nice. All in all we had an amazing time, and the apartment and its owners was a huge part of our Amsterdam expirience. Highly recommended."
84,26670416,2/17/2015,David,"Anita and Paul made us very welcome: knowing I was interested in the beer scene they researched places I could go and emailed it to me. We were provided with guide books and a folder of recommendations of local places to eat, shop and so on. They live next door and looked after our bags for us on our final day and we had a coffee and a chat.<br/><br/>The apartment is lovely - it is nicely decorated with books and ornaments and is well equipped, clean and bright. There is seating, a kitchen area, a dining table and a wet room with a shower. It has two double beds, one up a ladder on a mezzanine. They are effectively in the same room so there is not a lot of privacy. If you are coming with your family you may want to think about who sleeps where! There is also a balcony. We really appreciated being able to relax as a family after a day out and ""picnic"" together. There is no TV but there is wifi.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this apartment if you are not good with heights. The view outside is nice but you can see you are a long way up. The apartment is accessed via typical Dutch steep stairs - three flights. Having said that we ceased to notice them after a day or two.<br/>The de Pijpe area of Amsterdam has a real buzz and there are lots of great shops, bars and restaurants. If we had wanted to we could have easily filled our four days just here. In fact it was an advantage being away from the tourist-focused part of the city. Albert Cuyp Markt is in the next street too!<br/><br/>The flat is very quiet - you hear the odd motorbike on the street at night or emergency vehicle going past but otherwise nothing. The no. 4 tram runs down the street outside so you can get to the city centre in about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this letting. If you want to ""live like a local"" you couldn't do better."
84,26856725,2/21/2015,Stéphanie,"Un séjour très agréable chez Anita et Paul, qui sont des hôtes charmants et très attentionnés. Merci pour la bouteille de vin dans le frigo et les gaufrettes et les chocolats pour les enfants!<br/>Les photos sont tout a fait conformes à la réalité. C'est joli, cosy, chaleureux, très bien équipé.<br/>Nous étions une famille de 4 ( 1 adulte et <br/>3 enfants), et le studio convenait parfaitement pour un séjour de 5 jours.<br/>Le quartier est idéal, tout est à proximité: location de vélos, musées, marché aux puces, jolis restaurants, supermarché.<br/>Je partage l'adresse avec mes amies!"
84,27045156,2/24/2015,Christina,"Anita und Paul waren sehr herzliche Gastgeber, bei denen man sich wohl fühlt. Das Appartement ist, wie auf den Fotos zu sehen ist, mit sehr viel Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet und man hat alles was man braucht!"
84,27203186,2/28/2015,Claudia,Top locatie in de Pijp en klein maar fijn appartement. We voelden ons zeer welkom en hebben een zeer prettig verblijf gehad. Zeker een aanrader. 
84,27384104,3/3/2015,Rachel,"Anita was so welcomjng and had done lots of research on our behalf for the things we mentioned we liked....cocktail bars!! <br/>The apartment location is perfect a quiet street 2 minutes from the tram stop for the centre.  Room is a great size and the kitchen is a bonus with how well stocked it is for all the things you could need.  Plus the stairs....what a leg workout! Would stay here again. "
84,27573706,3/8/2015,Anya,"The flat was beautiful, cosy and we had everything needed for a comfortable stay, including a folder full of information on tourist attractions,  bike rental places, restaurants and things to do. The flat is in an amazing location close to a brilliant street market and a short bike ride into the city centre. Anita and Paul were both very welcoming, friendly and interesting to speak to. Would definitely stay again, cannot recommend them enough!<br/>"
84,27758841,3/11/2015,Francisco Jose,"La casa esta en un barrio bastante céntrico y rodeado de restaurantes, comercios , etc con lo que es muy cómodo.<br/>Relativamente cercana al centro y con conexión de tranvía perfecta.<br/>La casa tiene de todo, y a mis hijos les encantó el altillo para dormir.<br/>WIFI perfecta. Eso si, sin TV.<br/>Anita nos indico todo perfectamente , con mapas e incluso me dirigió a las afueras para poder aparcar el coche.<br/>Amsterdam es una ciudad para caminar...o bike...<br/>Recomiendo este alojamiento sin duda"
84,27988292,3/16/2015,Ashleigh & Calum,"Anita and Paul were excellent hosts, they gave us clear directions on how to get to the apartment, had a list of maps and activities for us to do on our stay and even invited us for a coffee. The apartment was in a good location and was accurately described and presented. "
84,28773915,3/30/2015,Christian,"Cosy, little apartment in a nice neighbourhood near amsterdam center. Found everything we need for our stay. Thanks a lot."
84,29088098,4/4/2015,Friederun,"Dear Anita,every thing was so lovely prepared by contact in advance of our visit. We could ask you everything and you found out  where to bye Gluten Free Food etc. It's a great flat with wonderful hosts, an exicting area of Amsterdam with good Connection to the Tram etc.  Thanks for everything and we will return! if time comes."
84,29540487,4/9/2015,Andrew,"We had a wonderful stay in Anita's apartment! We loved De Pijp which is very convenient for museums and galleries but great just to hang out in with great bars, restaurants, close to the Albert Cuypmarkt and the lovely Sarphatipark. Anita's apartment was perfect for the three of us & nicely furnished with interesting objects and lots of books. Although up some pretty steep typical Amsterdam stairs it is wonderfully quiet and overlooks gardens and other apartments. There is a nice balcony, although it was a bit too cold for us to sit out. Paul and Anita kindly invited us in for coffee and gave us lots of great information about local restaurants, supermarkets, microbreweries, where to get the best Surinamese food etc. Anita also provided us with really helpful details on how to get to the apartment and timetable information about early morning trams to the station so we could catch our early morning flight. A really great place to stay."
84,29810130,4/13/2015,Smith,"Anita & Paul could not have been nicer. They made invited us in for coffee and conversation when we arrived. The room was perfect. Flowers, Chocolate and a comfortable bed. Very good location for site seeing. I would recommend highly.<br/>"
84,30491499,4/23/2015,Christine,"Accueil très chaleureux de Paul et Anita  (Paul  parle très bien  le français ) qui nous ont contacté avant pour savoir notre heure d'arrivée et qui nous ont invitées au café durant notre séjour. A notre disposition plein d'infos pour la découverte d'Amsterdam (plans, adresses, cartes et guides ) . Le logement est tout à fait conforme aux photos et descriptif, très calme, tout près du tramway , dans un quartier vivant et agréable. Nous recommanderons cette adresse , excellent rapport qualité prix pour la ville d'Amsterdam."
84,30658186,4/26/2015,Gabriele,"Anita war die wundervollste Gastegeberin, die man und frau sich überhaupt vorstellen kann. Das Appartment ist schön eingerichtet - mit vielen Büchern! - und ausgestattet mit Informationen aller Art. Auch Anita selbst war hilfsbereit, voller Tipps - und zugleich wohltuend zurückhaltend. Besser könnte es nicht sein!"
84,30926317,4/29/2015,Fabien,"Nous sommes allés à Amsterdam pour le King's day. Et c'était un agréable séjour très bien reçu et accueillis.<br/><br/>It's was an excellent trip, with friends. This is a beautiful flat."
84,31158160,5/3/2015,Shannon,"I love Amsterdam and it's the people that make it special. Anita is no exception and made us feel very welcome including an early check in for a much needed nap. The apartment is extremely comfortable, well situated in a lively area yet blissfully quiet as the apartment faces into a large courtyard. Three levels of steep stairs were no problem for us but would be for an elderly person. Great walking into central Amsterdam and easy public transit access for train station, etc. Perfectly equipped kitchen for cooking, I always really appreciate the little extras like plastic wrap, oil, spices, etc. Thank you so much for the coffee, cookies and lovely bottle of wine Anita. That was unexpected and very kind of you. We'll see you again!"
84,31688936,5/9/2015,Kimie,"Most nicely- the owners! You must have a coffee with them to know what I am recommending about! Close enough (1 min walk) to the lively weekend market that you must visit. Super markets are within 3-5 mins distance w/ the fully equipped kitchen, this is paradise for visitors who want either to have their budgeted trip or to prepare own meal. From Station RAI to the airport Schiphol is the most ideal way; 10 min tram to city centre. Stairways can be a bit challenging for bigger baggage a as the studio is on the 3rd floor. :) "
84,32100180,5/14/2015,Jelena,"Anita and Paul were wonderful hosts. Anita even wait for us at airport and gave us all necessary information. Apartment is great. Everything you might need is there. Fully equipped kitchen, comfortable bed, more than enough towels and linens, nice terrace, wine, chocolate, books... Very clean, cosy and quiet. Good internet connection. Center of the city and museums are in the walking distance, maybe 20 min for all, and if you do not like to walk there is tram station near the apartment. It was really amazing and I would strongly recommend this apartment. Again, Anita and Paul thanks for all."
84,32738773,5/21/2015,André,Apartamento incrivel. Anita é uma pessoa especial e tivemos uma estadia perfeita. Apartamento completo... bairro muito bom e fizemos tudo a pé para todos os pontos de Amsterdam.

84,33349768,5/27/2015,Molly,Anita and her husband are amazing hosts. They are warm and generous and clearly love helping new visitors to their awesome city of Amsterdam. The apartment is gorgeous and cozy with the perfect amount of space and amenities. I had a great time!
84,33641097,5/31/2015,Heidi,"Anita was wonderful. We had chololate and wine to welcome us. Great lighting in the room and very comfortable. Location was great very short walk from the tram. There is also a street market 1 block. <br/>Anita, was very helpful before we arrived and while there. The room was fully stocked with blankets, pillows, towels and dishes. It felt like home. "
84,34048476,6/4/2015,Jacopo,"Anita e suo marito sono due persone fantastiche..disponibili e che ti mettono subito a tuo agio.. Appena arrivati (anzi anche prima di partire) ci hanno dato tutte le informazioni di cui necessitavamo (distanze, luoghi da visitare, mezzi, ristoranti, ecc) insomma sono due persone fantastiche. Per quanto riguarda l appartamento è un grazioso monolocale con soppalco ideale per 4 persone. Situato in una zona molto tranquilla e a due passi dalla zona di de Pjip molto frequentata da giovani e piena di bar per aperitivi cene o solo per fare due chiacchiere.. Ultra consigliata per la vicinanza della zona dei musei e per  l inizio della via del centro. Se ritornerò ad Amsterdam ti alloggerò sicuramente qui. Alla prossima! "
84,34267905,6/7/2015,Irmi,"It was a perfect trip for us. Apartment was nice and very clean with an excellent neighborhood - we had a perfect dinner in "" A la ferme"".<br/>Hope to come back to Amsterdam soon."
84,35058285,6/15/2015,Benedict,We had a lovely time staying in Anita and Paul’s wonderful apartment. It is in a very nice area and is a well-located base from which to explore the rest of Amsterdam. Anita and Paul were very welcoming and helpful. We would love to stay again. Many thanks.
84,35763728,6/22/2015,Deidre,"Absolutely lovely time had in this gorgeous apartment in a wonderful city. Our host Anita made us feel so welcome. The apartment was immaculate, and beautifully decorated. The captains bed was a particular draw for our daughter! We were welcomed with drinks in the fridge, as well as food to help ourselves to. Incredible hospitality. The apartment is in a charming part of the city. We were only there for a few days, and left with a sense that there was much more to explore. All amenities are readily available, and it is a short journey from the airport, and also to the museum district.  I cannot rate our stay highly enough, and highly recommend it! "
84,36528870,6/29/2015,Sophie,"We had an amazing time during our stay at Anitas and Pauls appartment.<br/>They are such a nice couple and hosts!<br/>The appartment was lovely, with a little balcony where you can sit and enjoy a glass of wine or a nice breakfast. <br/>We will definitely come back :) <br/><br/>Thanks Anita and Paul! <br/>Greets, Sophie, Nina, Lilli and Niko"

84,37826799,7/11/2015,Laura,"It was an absolute joy staying at Anita's apartment. Check-in was nice and easy and she was by far, the most helpful host we've had. She has maps, a folder full of restaurant suggestions, brochures and an excellent knowledge of the area.<br/>As for the apartment, it was a lovely base to explore the city of Amsterdam. Anita provided us with absolutely everything we needed and the bright, spacious space was lovely to come back to after a day of sightseeing. We also loved the fact that it was just one street away from the Albert Cuyptmarkt - which is a must see! <br/>Would definitely stay here again!"
84,38246591,7/14/2015,Hedy,"Imagine coming home after a tiring day and resting in a clean and freshly washed bed. Anita's house surpasses this, it is a charming, clean and spacious place. If you want to try living in a true Amsterdam home then this is the place for you.  Everything was prepared for us when we arrived and Anita was very welcoming. She took the time to explain how to use all the machines and even showed us a booklet she had compiled on information about all the nice places and things to do in town. We have never met a host as caring as Anita. We thank her for this wonderful time! If we ever return then one of the reasons will be so that we can stay at Anita's place once again. It was a perfect home away from home."
84,38580631,7/17/2015,Peter,"Anita was a great host. When my girlfriend and I came in we were supplied with a map and locations that we might be interested in (20min walk from major museums). When we got into the room, it was beautiful, exactly as it is shown on the website. With a nice veranda. If you want a great base for a trip to Amsterdam Anita's is in a great location with a knowlegable host.<br/><br/>"
84,39021763,7/20/2015,Marie,"Very lovely place, located in a very lively part of Amsterdam, particularly convenient to visit the city by feet. Anita is extremely welcoming and helpful. The flat is fully (and nicely) equipped and responds to any possible need. I can only warmly recommend the place & thanks again for ou very pleasant stay !"
84,39397848,7/23/2015,Laura,"A fantastic place to stay. Anita was really helpful and friendly she gave us some good advice on where to eat. A great area, very trendy full of great bars and cafes and very easy to get to all the tourist attractions. A beautiful and welcoming apartment."
84,40329166,7/30/2015,Sophie,"This apartment is by far the best airbnb experience I have had. Not only is the apartment gorgeous, full of light and an amazing bookcase, this apartment has the most lovely positive energy. The area is amazing and I walked everywhere. I was welcomed warmly by Anita and during my stay found all the little things she did such as fresh flowers, little waffles, a bottle of wine, extremely clean home etc all beyond the normal standard. I give this my have guest recommendation. Absolutely perfect."
84,41605685,8/8/2015,Aruj,"This apartment is absolutely gorgeous, it is exactly like in the pictures, cosy and comfortable, we stayed there for a week and we couldn’t ask for a better location.  10 min walk to the Heineken brewery/Museum square, 15 min walk to Vondel Park, bike rental place around the corner and tram stop 2 minutes away.  Unfortunately we didn’t get to meet the host but their friends welcomed us like family.  We would definitely stay there again! Thank you!!"
84,42135972,8/11/2015,Emmy,"What a perfect host and location! Anita's apartment was quaint, cosy and in a great location but still managed to feel spacious and supplied us with everything we needed for our trip to Amsterdam and more. Anita provided excellent directions so we could find her apartment easily and had a folder on recommendations for food and things to do in Amsterdam, many of which we tried and enjoyed very much. The apartment was clean and well stocked and was in walking distance of the centre but also had some excellent shops, restaurants, parks and markets within a 5 minute radius. Could not recommend staying at Anita's highly enough. AMAZING. "
84,42536200,8/14/2015,Alice,Anita and Paul were not there during our stay. Their good friend Claire was here to welcome us. She was very friendly and helpful and we have appreciated that Claire spoke french with us. The apartment was clean and pleasant to live. Anita and Paul left us a file with many good  recommandations. It was very difficult for us to hoist our heavy luggages to the 3d floor because of the steep stairs but it is classic in Amsterdam. We recommand this flat !
84,43620587,8/21/2015,Fabio,"Siamo stati in questo appartamento in tre persone, io mia moglie e il nostro figlio di 16 anni e vi era spazio più che sufficiente per tutti in totale comodità.<br/>L'appartamento è come descritto, anche meglio che nelle fotografie. Pulito e ottimamente fornito, acqua in frigorifero al nostro arrivo, birra, una bottiglia di vino, frutta. A disposizione caffè, olio, prodotti per la colazione tipo corn flakes e molto altro...<br/>Lavatrice, lavapiatti, prodotti di igiene personale, insomma potete non portarvi nulla da casa tranne i vestiti!<br/>Anita gentilissima e sempre presente al bisogno.<br/>Un posto eccezionale dove torneremo volentieri.<br/>Dimenticavo la posizione, in una zona molto bella e comoda a tutto, si può andare ovunque a piedi!<br/>"
84,44530226,8/27/2015,Ros,"Anita was very welcoming and helpful, the flat was exactly as it had been described and was perfect for a short break. Close to the town centre, 20 min walk, 5 min tram ride, the area was lively and felt very safe. Great city, lots to do. Bike tour recommended - We Bike Amsterdam (Jasper) - well worth looking up."
84,45460995,9/3/2015,Erica And Jason,"This was the perfect place to stay during our visit to Amsterdam! Anita was very kind and accommodating, and provided a ton of information on local places to eat, drink, etc. Truly a super host! <br/><br/>The apartment was comfortable and clean and very well located in the amazing De Pijp neighbourhood. It should be noted that the apartment is three or four floors up a very steep staircase, which adds to the uniqueness and charm of the place, but may mean it isn't an appropriate choice for those with physical mobility concerns. That said, we loved our stay in this apartment and would recommend it to anyone planning a visit to Amsterdam!"
84,45763673,9/6/2015,Dave,"Wonderful stay with two awesome hosts. The flat was perfect for the two of us with everything we needed. Great location, near tram stops, canal rides, the market and the Rijksmuseum; plus much more. Very quiet and warm. Thanks for making our first AirBnB such an awesome time and such a breeze; great help and great directions provided."
84,46571026,9/12/2015,Rachel,"Anita made us feel extremely welcome. She let us drop our bags off before check in and leave them there on the day we checked out until we caught our plane, she put together lots of maps and information about Amsterdam and the local area which was all really helpful. She even checked how we were doing half way through the week and asked if there was anything she could do for us which was lovely. We loved the apartment, it was lovely and quiet, nice and bright, clean and very cosy. De Pijp is a fantastic place to stay as there is lots going on – lovely shops, restaurants and a brilliant market on the adjacent street. "
84,47140085,9/16/2015,Todd And Tabitha,"My wife and I enjoyed a 4 night stay in this wonderful flat in Amsterdam. We can't express enough how amazing our hosts Anita and Paul were.  We enjoyed some wine, espresso and great conversation.  <br/>The flat was fully outfitted and exactly as described in the pictures and adds. The bed was large and very comfortable ( we are pretty picky with beds). The apartment and area was extremely quiet as well. <br/>We walked all over Amsterdam from this location as its only about 30 mins to anywhere in the city center.  If you have mobility issues the stairs will be an issue. <br/>We highly recommend staying here to anyone that is looking to explore Amsterdam.  <br/><br/>Thanks for adding to our wonderful Amsterdam experience.   <br/><br/>Todd and Tabitha<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
84,47610468,9/21/2015,Clayton,"Anita's apartment was absolutely great. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The location is excellent! My wife and I walked everywhere and didn't have to use public transportation. The neighborhood has many food options and also has a fantastic market very close. Anita is a model host! She was knowledgeable about the area, attentive to all of our questions, very flexible to our needs, respectful of our space, the list could go on and on. This was our first AirBNB and I fear Anita has set the bar too high for other hosts! Thanks again for the stay!"
84,49305677,10/3/2015,Tiago,"Anita and Paul are just awesome hosts. Anita was there to receive us and explain everything about the apartment. The apartment is really like in the pictures: cozy, beautiful and makes you feel like home. The wi-fi is great, the kitchen has everything you need, the bed is very very comfortable. The neighbourhood is great, with many restaurantes, stores, markets, and really easy to go walking to the the center. I did't rent a bike and just walked through Amsterdam. Lovely city, lovely apartment, lovely hosts!"
84,49757184,10/6/2015,Ed,"Wonderful apt in great area. Very gracious and accommodating hosts. We loved everything g about it and highly recommend it, without question would book again. Thanks Anita "
84,50264713,10/11/2015,Livia,"Der Aufenthalt in Anita's Wohnung war grossartig! Das Apartment ist herzlich, sauber, gut ausgestattet und sogar mit einem süssen Balkon versehen!<br/>Die Begrüssung war sehr herzlich, Anita nahm sich genügen Zeit für uns, erklärte uns alles und war jederzeit erreichbar für uns.<br/>Einen Aufenthalt bei Anita kann ich nur weiterempfehlen!"
84,50828820,10/15/2015,Jane,"What a perfect space. Anita has thought of everything to make her guests stay as comfortable as possible. The apartment is delightful, with everything you could need. Spotlessly clean, cosy and fresh. The information booklet is extremely well thought out, covering all sorts of fascinating details.<br/>We were welcomed warmly and given an excellent overview of the apartment and the local area. We were unfortunately later than planned, due to roadworks, but Anita was gracious and kind, despite having her own travel plans effected.<br/>The location in De Pijp is perfect, we walked everywhere. Great shops, cafes. I would love to go back very soon!"
84,51422417,10/20/2015,Myosotis,Very well prepared. Good location. Highly recommended.
84,51687277,10/24/2015,Karen,"Anita was de gastvrouw voor onze oudste 16-jarige dochter die voor het eerst Amsterdam met haar Franse vriendinnen kwam bezoeken. Zijzelf vond dit gezellige en frisse appartement in leuke buurt en centraal gelegen enkele maanden geleden via Airbnb en sindsdien hadden zowel ik als ouder als onze dochter Danne zelf over verschillende zaken contact met Anita. Anita was altijd snel, vriendelijk, behulpzaam en vertrouwenwekkend in haar communicatie. Top dus (want best spannend voor de ouders zo'n eerste keer je dochter op stap alleen naar Nederland ;)). De meiden hebben 100% geprofiteerd van het gezellige en fijne plekje dat Anita heeft weten te creeren! En wijzelf gaan zeker ook een keer! Veel dank!!"
84,52390110,10/29/2015,Robert,"Anita hat uns sehr herzlich in dem wunderschönen, typischen Amsterdamer Haus empfangen. Dort fanden wir alles so vor, wie wir es uns nach der Beschreibung und den Fotos vorgestellt haben. Wir waren zu viert, mit 2 jugendlichen ""Kindern"", unterwegs. Die waren von ihrer Schlafstätte auf der 2. Ebene begeistert, hatten sie so doch auch ihre eigene Sphäre, in die sie sich abends zurückziehen konnten. Die Einrichtung ist sehr hell und gemütlich, so dass wir uns schnell zu Hause fühlten. Die Küche ist sehr gut ausgestattet und sogar der Kühlschrank war mit einer kleinen Erfrischung für den ersten Durst gefüllt. Anita hat für ihre Gäste viel Infomaterial vorbereitet, und gab uns Tipps für preiswerte und leckere Lokale und andere Insidertipps, die wir dankbar aufnahmen. Von der Unterkunft aus konnten wir zu Fuß gut zum Museumsplein, zum Grachtenring und in die City gelangen. In der direkten Umgebung gibt es viele Imbisse und Restaurants und gemütliche Kneipen. Wir können Anitas  Charming Apartment also jedem empfehlen, der in Amsterdam Urlaub machen möchte und die Intimität und Behaglichkeit eines Apartments schätzt.   <br/>Viel Spass in Amsterdam wünschen Christiane & Robert"
84,52669171,11/1/2015,Howard,"Lovely well-appointed apartment in a really nice area of Amsterdam. Anita was so charming, kind and helpful. Plenty of room for four of us and a great base for exploring – we walked everywhere. Can’t recommend highly enough. We love Amsterdam and we love Anita’s apartment. "
84,53168452,11/6/2015,Stuart,"Anita was a great host and very friendly. She was in touch before we arrived to give directions to the apartment which was very helpful. When we arrived she sat with us and went through an extensive list of places to shop, eat, drink and visit. The amount of work in the folder she left us with was impressive and it proved a great source of information. Anita kept in touch throughout our stay and was very helpful beyond what would normally be required. I would definitely recommend her apartment, it is very homely and has all you need for your stay. The street is very quite yet it is very close to a number of great bars, restaurants and a daily market."
84,53673064,11/11/2015,Vanessa,"Ho fatto una sorpresa a mio marito per il suo compleanno e Anita, la padrona di casa, mi ha aiutato tantissimo e la sorpresa è davvero riuscita. Anita è molto disponibile e gentile ed è super preparata a dare tutte le informazioni necessarie per avere un buon soggiorno in città. L'appartamento poi è davvero davvero carino! E' situato in una zona lontana dal caos ma vicinissima al centro perché ben servita dai mezzi, molto ben arredato e curato nei dettagli anche se piccolo ma molto molto intimo e la cucina è attrezzatissima . Consiglio questo appartamento per chi è amante della tranquillità e vuol vivere una vacanza da vero olandese."
84,53950227,11/15/2015,Alexia,"Logement absolument parfait, dans un quartier très sympathique. Anita et Paul sont des gens absolument fabuleux, il n'y a pas de mot pour décrire leur gentillesse et leur attention à notre égard à un moment difficile pour des parisiens.<br/>Leur accueil et le logement ont été merveilleux, merci encore à eux !"
84,54570355,11/22/2015,Heather,What a wonderful place to stay. Great neighborhood and Anita has put a binder together of all the local things to do. We also had to change some of our travel plans and she was very helpful. 4 of us stayed in this apartment very comfortably and have all said if we return to Amsterdam we would rent from her again. Delightful experience!
84,54862028,11/25/2015,Miranda,Anita was so accommodating! The location and apartment were perfect. We had an incredible time!
84,55348651,12/1/2015,Darren,"My wife and I had an awesome experience in Amsterdam.  Anita gave us a very warm welcome, informed us of the neighbourhood and what's available.  We had everything we needed throughout, and Anita was available for any questions at all times.  "
84,55892107,12/7/2015,Imelda,"Our hostess was generous, and went the extra mile. (wine and flavoured teas provided ). She kindly rang to change the taxi. Accommodation was fine and the neighbourhood fine. We were very satisfied and would go again and recommend it.<br/>"
84,56713084,12/17/2015,Louis,"We had an amazing experience staying in this charming little apartment. The setting is great, the hosts are friendly and very accommodating and the facilities of a very high standard. Definitely recommend this place.  "
84,57161550,12/22/2015,Luc,We werden warm onthaald bij Anita. De studio op derde verdieping is ruim en van alle comfort voorzien. De ligging is vlot te vinden vanaf snelweg. Goedkope parking op minder dan 1 km. 30 euro voor vier dagen! Ook goed gelegen om stad in te trekken.  S nachts heel rustig geslapen. Keukentje voll ingericht! Een aanrader!! We willen graag terugkomen!! 
84,57481666,12/26/2015,Rob,"Paul and Anita's place was the perfect Amsterdam get away! We spent Christmas week at this flat and couldn't have asked for a merrier time. The flat is cozy and bright... we were never short of blankets or pillows! It also has a very well equipped kitchen with several essential cooking spices and oils as well as utensils; which was helpful for cooking our Christmas dinner. The location is great--major attractions were just a stroll away. Anita and Paul were so welcoming and responded to any questions right away. They had a great list and selection of helpful books to make your way through Amsterdam. Overall, we had an amazing time at this quiet and comfy Dutch flat. R and J"
84,59627869,1/13/2016,Cathy And Jerome,"Anita and Paul are exceptional hosts. Our stay was wonderful. The fresh flowers, the extra towels, the guide books, they thought of every detail. Once again, thank you for your blissful care. Cathy and Jerome"
84,59991199,1/18/2016,Katie,"Anita met us at the door when we arrived and showed us up to the apartment (and even helped carry our suitcase up the very steep stairs - thank you!). She provided us with a very helpful book that had lots of information about the area and the best restaurants to go to (can highly recommend De Pizzabakkers and Barra! Both just a minutes walk away). <br/>The apartment was really beautiful, spotlessly clean and equipped with everything you could need. It was very cold during our stay but the appartment is thankfully heated and the bed is very comfortable and cosy - there are even extra blankets if you need them. <br/>The apartment is in a really nice neighbourhood, with plenty of restaurants and a market really near by. You can easily walk into the city too, or if you don't like walking there is a tram stop close by. <br/>Thanks again Anita - we had a really great stay."
84,60949686,1/30/2016,Mark &  Annette,"Anita was very welcoming & helped us carry our heavy suitcases up the steep stairs. We were greeted with a bottle of Proseco to celebrate a special occasion. The place is well-equipped & Anita has a great manual and provided great tips. <br/><br/>We don't remember reading about the very steep steps when initially making the booking and were somewhat surprised (the stairs are of course typical of most inner city abodes in Amsterdam); they proved somewhat difficult for my mom who's super fit but had a foot  operation two years back. "
84,61491316,2/5/2016,Celine,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Anita and Paul's studio apartment for 4 days. We were so happy with the place, it really couldn't have been nicer! It's a great location within walking distance of everything. Anita was so helpful and gave us all the information we would need. I would recommend staying here and I would love to go back!"
84,61753744,2/8/2016,Sarah,"Anita was a great host, providing detailed information about local amenities and Amsterdam in general. The room was clean, tidy and full of various products you might need such as oils, spreads, spices and kitchen crockery.<br/><br/>Anita kept in touch but also left us to do our own thing, and was kind enough to look after our bags for a while after we checked out."
84,62149775,2/12/2016,Aleksandra,"Urocze miejsce w bardzo dobrej lokalizacji (dobre połączenie m.in. z Centrum i Amsterdam RAI). Apartament był czysty i bardzo dobrze wyposażony.<br/>Anita jest fantastyczną osobą, która udzieliła nam wielu cennych wskazówek podczas naszego pobytu.<br/>Dziękujemy!"
84,62692216,2/16/2016,Paul,"Anita's apartment was really nice and confortable. It is really near to the city center (around 5-10 minutes in tramway from the central station) and you will find what you need for a short or long journey (even a bottle of wine !).<br/>Anita met us personally and gave many informations about Amsterdam (restaurant, museum, bar...). She and her husband were very kind and helpful.<br/>I will highly recommend this apartment to all my friends or for someone who want to make a trip to this city ! <br/>"
84,63466187,2/23/2016,Henry,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in February and it was honestly the best experience! The flat is lovely, had everything you could need during your stay, was clean and tidy, and even stocked with snacks and a few drinks.<br/><br/>The location is ideal with it being just around the corner from sweet local bakeries and restaurants, as well as Albert Cuypmarkt where we could buy fresh food to prepare in the flat. The apartment itself maybe doesn’t have the most beautiful view out the windows, but who cares when there’s so much to do and see right on your doorstep? The neighbourhood itself felt safe and quaint, with a few shops and cafes, without feeling too crowded or at all tourist-y. In terms of getting around, it’s just a short, picturesque walk from the museum district; from a stop for the hop-on-hop-off canal boats; and from a tram which takes you directly into the centre of town in just minutes. Even getting to and from the airport was easy.<br/><br/>Anita and Paul were so welcoming and lovely also. Before we set out for Amsterdam, they gave us all the information we would need to make it to the flat and they were flexible with check-in/check-out and leaving our bags in the flat etc. When we arrived they made sure we were happy, answered all our questions and provided us with their tips for eating and entertainment in the neighbourhood which was so great.<br/><br/>All in all, we had the best time in this apartment. We felt almost like locals the whole time we were there."
84,64375076,3/3/2016,Gilles,"Very nice flat ... just with terrific stairs to get in !<br/>Anita is a very kind host. We recommend the flat and the destination"
84,64585683,3/6/2016,Elle,"Just returned from a fantastic 3 night stay in this lovely apartment! <br/><br/>Anita met us with a friendly welcome and provided us with useful information about the city and the area we were in. The directions she gave to find the apartment were easy to follow and a relatively quick journey from the airport!<br/><br/>The apartment it's self was homely and comfortable! Hangers, towels, hair dryer and shampoo's were all provided which are fab especially if you are travelling with a small suitcase. <br/><br/>The location of the apartment is great and a short walk from bars & resturants. To the centre of Amsterdam took us roughly 30 minutes (without getting too lost!) but there is a tram station a couple of minutes away from the apartment that takes you in the heart of the city if you don't fancy walking!<br/><br/>Overall 10 out of 10 stay and apartment and would recommend to anyone! "
84,65050612,3/10/2016,Verity,The listing description and images was exactly as you saw it so the room was really spacious and well equipped for making food as well as sleeping 4 people easily. Anita was really helpful as a host and provided us with some maps and guidebooks of the city and things to do/ places to eat. We had a very relaxed three days and even though you are high up there is a balcony where you can sit. The apartment is everything we wanted for our vacation and we would definitely come back to this apartment. Very walm and comfortable as well as being so close to the city centre. 
84,65987560,3/18/2016,Zhuoran,Anita is the best of the best landlady. Everything is good.i think i am lucky to choose the house of the Anita.
84,66408345,3/22/2016,Rebecca,"Charming apartment is the perfect description! The flat was much more spacious than it appears in the pictures, very bright and very clean. A perfect spot to rest in between sightseeing trips! Anita was a lovely and welcoming host, very warm to communicate with and gave us great tips about the city. I'd highly recommend choosing this apartment for your city break :) perfectly located for trams or a walk to central station, easy access from the airport, and near lots of local amenities like supermarkets, cafes and restaurants."
84,67367886,3/29/2016,Margit,"We can thoroughly recommend this apartment to all travellers looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam.  The directions from Anita to the apartment were clear and the communication by Anita prior to our trip was great as we were able to ask some questions she kindly answered.  It was so sweet to have little extra personal touches such as a bunch of daffodils on the table, snacks and drinks and all the information about Amsterdam available for us.  The neighbourhood is lively full of eating places, supermarkets and a lovely bakery.  We even got a surprise of a box of Easter eggs left for us on our return one day as we were staying over Easter.  On the check out we could leave our luggage with the hosts until our flight in the evening.  It's so great to have the extra space, peace and quiet compared with a stay at the hotel.  <br/><br/>Our teenage daughter loved the loft space she could have to herself and also the wifi access as teenagers do. <br/><br/>I cannot recommend this apartment enough to all travellers and would definitely stay there again if an opportunity arises."
84,68109521,4/2/2016,Tim,"The apartment is very charming, we felt at home immediately. The apartement is well equipped with everything you need, very quiet and near to the center, lots of supermarkets, cafes and restaurants. "
84,68363747,4/4/2016,Jonathan,The loft was a very unique space in a fantastic part of Amsterdam (De Pijp).  The place has everything that's needed - the stroopwaffle is a nice touch.  I particularly liked the outdoor balcony.  I should note that the stairs up to the apartment are pretty steep (as many are in AMS) so just take caution if you consume a few too many gin & tonics.  Anita is a fantastic host.  She provided neighborhood recommendations and checked in on us to ensure our stay was going well.  Would definitely recommend.
84,69221630,4/10/2016,Xiaoshu,Anita's house is really sweet. We enjoy ourselves there. Everything is good.
84,69742540,4/13/2016,Gabriel,"Anita was an amazing host! Even if she was traveling on the days of my stay, she was very kind to send her friend to receive us, and to answer every message I sent to her. Her flat is incredible cozy and cute, in a perfect area. Everything is as good as on the pictures. It was one of my best experiences with airbnb, and I truly recommend it."
84,70221768,4/17/2016,Robinson,Very pleasant apartment ideal for parents with kids in Pijp district THE new trendy place to be in Amsterdam great cafes great restaurant beautiful park. Place to rent bikes just nearby. The apartment is neat and with great charm very bright. 
84,70725734,4/20/2016,Chris,"Anita's loft apartment was a great space for us to stay during our short trip to Amsterdam, and Anita herself was a wonderful host - full of advice and suggestions for places to visit, in the local area and beyond.  We'll be sure to stay here again if we return!"
84,71644211,4/27/2016,Charles,Excellent. 
84,72570148,5/3/2016,Chihin,Anita was super friendly and welcomed us on the first day. The apartment was definitely the most homey experience I've ever had on Airbnb. The decor in the apartment was pleasant; kitchen was well stocked and equipped. Attention to details throughout the place made our stay really smooth and everything convenient for us. Really close to albertcuyp market and tram #4 which will take you to Amsterdam centraal. <br/><br/>The stair to the attic bed (not the main bed) is a bit steep so pay attention to that if you have knee issues. 
84,73526065,5/8/2016,Pauliina,"We had a wonderful weekend in Amsterdam. We highly recommend Anita's cosy apartment, if going there. The location is perfect: a lot of really good cafes and restaurants nearby. The neighbourhood is lively but also peaceful enough. Albert Cuyp Market is right nextdoor, and there is also nice parks nearby.  Although there are a lot of people on the market everyday and on a warm and sunny day the restaurants and cafes are crowded, the apartment itself is suprisingly peaceful and quite! Anita made us feel very welcome and was very helpful and available all the time. The apartment is well equipted, and there is a lot of travelling guides, restaurant tips and maps for planning the next days adventures! "
84,74091367,5/13/2016,Janessa,We had the most incredible time in Amsterdam because of Anita. When our bikes were taken by the government she helped us get them back. She went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. I couldn't Imagine a better host! 
84,74698156,5/16/2016,Hannah,"We had a great time in Amsterdam and enjoyed staying in Anita's apartment. Anita was a great host, she sent us a lot of information about the airport transfer before we arrived and was on hand to answer any questions during our visit. The apartment is really nice, well furnished and in a great location. There are also plenty of useful travel guides and maps to borrow!! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to any friends that are visiting Amsterdam. "
84,75305017,5/20/2016,Mandy,"Anita and Paul are very nice host that offer us a lot of advices and assistance, which helped us to enjoy our stay in Amsterdam!

84,75932239,5/23/2016,Eggtart,"Thanks Anita for all her help and her lovely place! She provided warm and detailed assistant on our stay. <br/>The place is quiet but convenient, easy to go anywhere in Amsterdam. "
84,76465076,5/27/2016,Céline,"I rented the flat for my parents in law, and they had a blast! They absolutely loved the flat itself, said it was very quiet, beautiful, and fully furnished with everything you might need from dryer to marmelade. They also found Anita very friendly and she gave them good tips about getting around and such."
84,77546625,6/1/2016,Philippa,"Me, my husband and 14 year old son had a fantastic few days in Amsterdam and at Anita's apartment. The location is great and the De Pijp area has lots of interesting places to eat and wander around. The apartment is well equipped and Anita had left some basics for our arrival. The apartment is quiet and the bed super comfy. We had some sunshine whilst we we there and sat out on the little balcony feeling like we were locals. Thank you Anita, you were really helpful and caring. We would definitely recommend the apartment and would come back ourselves when next in Amsterdam. "
84,78166274,6/5/2016,Joel,We had a great time in Amsterdam. The apartment was perfect and in a great location. The host was super nice and helpful. We would love to stay here again next time we are in Amsterdam. 
84,78843316,6/9/2016,Benjamin,"Anita was very communicative, and showed us around the apartment.  The space is clean, neat, and she left some surprises in the fridge!  It is in a really good area, with easy access to restaurants, shoppes, and downtown!  Highly recommended!"
84,81201123,6/21/2016,Kate,Anita was very knowledgable and extremely helpful - she gave us lots of great recommendations. Perfect location to explore Amsterdam! De Pijp is an amazing neighbourhood with lots of great cafes and bars. The place looks just like the pictures. Will definitely be staying here again in the future! :) 
84,81699618,6/24/2016,Oriol,Uno de los mejores apartamentos donde nunca hemos estado. Lo aconsejamos a todo tanto por su localizacion como por la disponibilidad y simpatia de los huespedes.
84,82485618,6/27/2016,Maribel,"<br/>Anita y Paul nos recibieron muy bien.<br/>Había algún detallito para los desayunos como mermeladas variadas, mantequilla y galletas típicas holandesas. Tampoco faltaba lo básico para poder cocinar, detergente para la lavadora y el lavavajillas así como gel de baño.<br/>Mi marido y yo, fuimos con nuestra hija y su pareja. Ellos dormían en la cama de la buhardilla, una pequeña estancia muy acogedora.<br/>Tuvimos suerte con el tiempo y pudimos aprovechar la terraza.<br/>Estuvimos 4 días y la verdad que nos encontramos muy cómodos en el apartamento. Después de estar durante todo el día recorriendo Amsterdam y algunos pueblos cercanos, se agradecía volver al apartamento.<br/><br/>Muchas gracias a Anita y Paul por todo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
84,83394190,7/2/2016,Kari,"Anita is a charming person who welcomed me in out of the rain when I arrived much earlier than check-in, gave me tea and a chat and then looked after my bags while I went out until the apartment was ready. She was equally accommodating about my departure.<br/><br/>Not knowing Amsterdam well, I really waffled in deciding where to stay. This turned out to be a great neighborhood for me--close enough that the historic city center is easily accessible, but enough out of it to have a sense of ""real"" Amserdam and a nice retreat from the tourist madness in the heart of the old city. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed being here and the apartment had everything I could have needed."
84,85523473,7/11/2016,Xenia,Anita hat uns schon vorab bei der Anreise geholfen wie wir am schnellsten zum Appartment kommen. Es hat alles super geklappt! Sie hat uns herzlich begrüsst und reichlich mit Informationen über Amsterdam und unsere Nachbarschaft versorgt. Wir haben uns gut aufgehoben gefühlt. Die Lage ist optimal um Amsterdam - zu Fuss oder mit dem Rad - zu erforschen. 
84,86470594,7/16/2016,Rowan,"She welcomed us as soon as we arrived, giving us a small tour of the apartment. She provided a book for us which included lots of really helpful information, such as local restaurants and how to work the appliances in the apartment. She had also partially stocked the fridge for us when we arrived, so we could immediately enjoy a cold drink! It was an amazing stay, and we all loved it."
84,87346701,7/19/2016,Théophile,Very nice appartment and we really enjoyed our stay.  Anita is really welcoming  :) i highly recomand this flat
84,88021595,7/22/2016,Sarah,"A great place with a great host to book for a great holiday in Amsterdam. Within walking distance from the canals and extremely accessible to the centre and attractions with a tram stop almost on the doorstep. <br/><br/>Anita was an amazing host going above and beyond what we expected. All the necessities were already there making it easy for us to settle in and enjoy our stay. She kept in regular contact to check we were finding everything well, providing maps and suggestions as to what to do as well<br/><br/>We can't wait to come back and stay again! Such great value for money. <br/><br/>"
84,90646216,8/1/2016,Peter,"Anita was very proactive and responsive. It was easy to find my way to the apartment with her directions and I appreciated the early check in. The apartment was fantastic, light and airy and great for a long weekend. All of the amenities you need are included, the wifi is strong, and the bathroom is spacious. Great location, near a bunch of cool coffee shops and a quick bike ride from anything in Amsterdam. I would definitely stay here again. "
84,91265345,8/4/2016,Jolie,"Anita was amazing, really helpful and friendly from booking right up until our departure. Not only did she provide for our every need (including stocking the fridge and giving us extensive knowledge of the area) but her apartment was a really lovely cosy getaway! Would definitely stay she's again ❤️"
84,92905121,8/10/2016,Lizzie,"Anita was the perfect host! She was super helpful in pointing out areas of interest in the area, and made us feel extremely welcome. She had even stocked the fridge, and allowed us to leave our luggage with her on our last day as we had a late flight. <br/>The apartment itself was lovely and a perfect size, and was just as shown in the photos. Everything was clean, tidy, and homely. It was especially nice to be able to sit out on the balcony. <br/>Despite being in a central location, the neighbourhood was peaceful, and it was very easy to walk into the centre of town and to other attractions.<br/>Overall a brilliant host and apartment, and we would definitely stay here again!"
84,93683782,8/13/2016,Susanne,"Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt in der Wohnung, sie hat uns das Gefühl vermittelt, für ein paar Tage an einem anderen Ort wie zu Hause zu sein. Die Atmophäre ist sehr angenehm, Anita ist eine sehr nette, aufgeschlossene und herzliche Gastgeberin. Wir kommen gerne wieder. "
84,94941861,8/17/2016,Debbie,"The apartment was clean and had everything you needed.  Anita had left a bottle of wine and plenty of cleaning supplies, toiletries and snacks.  The location was great - so we were able to enjoy the local cafe's, bars and restaurants which were a bit more off the beaten track and yet you could walk to Centraal Station within 30 minutes.  Anita is a lovely host with lots of information available about the area.  She is very friendly and kind and very keen to ensure your stay is good - and it was.  <br/><br/>Anita gave us brilliant directions to get us to the apartment and was there to welcome us on our arrival.  However, she was also very discreet during our stay allowing us to come and go as we pleased.<br/><br/>We had a great time exploring Amsterdam and would happily recommend this accommodation to any Airbnb customer."
84,97921616,8/28/2016,Victoria,Gorgeous flat in central location. Everything was provided and made to feel very welcome. Thank you to Anita and her friend Claire
84,98760373,9/1/2016,Isabel,"Sehr gemütliches 1-Zimmer-Appartment mit 2 Doppelbetten, kleinem Balkon und allem in Küche und Bad, was man braucht. Für Familie mit größeren Kindern super geeignet. Für kleinere Kinder oder ältere Personen wegen der steilen Treppen und der offenen Liegefläche unter dem Giebel vielleicht nicht so ideal. Tolles Wohnviertel mit Supermarkt, Fahrradverleih, Restaurants und täglichem Markt direkt um die Ecke. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und würden es sofort wieder buchen. Liebe Anita, vielen Dank für die super Betreuung, die vielen guten Tipps und das Versorgungspaket zur Begrüßung!!"
84,99426007,9/4/2016,Matthew,"Anita is a fantastic host. The apartment is lovely and spacious enough for the three of us. She puts a lot of effort into the little things, complimentary butter, biscuits, vino etc. She was accomodating for our friends broken foot. She handled the Amsterdam stairs no worries. <br/><br/>Her tips for breakfast and dinner were great. A full guide book is provided on arrival.<br/><br/>Above All else, you can not go past this location. We absolutely loved De pijp, restaurants and bars all winithin walking distance, too many to choose from!<br/><br/>We hope to be back."
84,100162536,9/7/2016,Katie And Dan,Great apartment! Great communication! Anita provided us with a ton of information about the area and it really helped. You can tell she wants her guests to enjoy their time in Amsterdam. Location is great and the apartment is charming and relaxing. We enjoyed our stay immensely. 
84,101703230,9/14/2016,Michele,"The apartment is big, clean and comfortable. Anita and her husband are very friendly.<br/>Tram stops are 2 minutes walking, perfect to go to RAI or City center.<br/>As usual in Amsterdam stairs are steep and the apartment is on third floor.<br/>The quality of sleep is great, no noisy bars nor restaurants.<br/>Will go back for sure when in Amsterdam."
84,102693667,9/18/2016,Damien,Anita was very kind and hospitable. The place is exactly as shown in photos. Everything was very nice and clean. We really loved her place. We will be back!
84,103332508,9/21/2016,Morgan,"Walking into Anita's apartment, we both exclaimed, ""It looks JUST like the pictures!"" Very bright, functional, and perfect for a vacation spot. Anita is so lovely, a great communicator, and very friendly and welcoming. The apartment was immaculately clean, lots of books, comfortable beds, and in a great neighbourhood that feels calm, inviting, and less crowded than the downtown - De Pijp is truly charming without being pretentious and I can't wait to stay again. Many great restaurants within 2 minutes, including the Market. Wow! Thanks, Anita! "
84,103903411,9/24/2016,Margaret,Smaller than it seemed in pictures but clean. It seems overpriced but the neighborhood is epic.
84,106043057,10/3/2016,Katrin,"Meine Freundin, unser gemeinsamer Patensohn und ich hatten den besten Platz in Amsterdam, den man sich nur wünschen kann! Anita hat uns trotz später Ankunft wunderbar in Empfang genommen, nachdem wir den Weg vom Flughafen durch ihre Beschreibung gut und schnell gemeistert haben. Die Wohnung war nicht nur sauber und alle meine Mitreisenden durch ihren Charme begeisternd, sondern auch ausgestattet mit einer Flasche Wein und sonstigem Überlebenswichtigem. Patensohn Noah war wunderbar in der Dachkoje untergebracht!<br/>De Pijp ist ein lebendiges, quirliges, aber nicht touritisch stressendes Stadtviertel, in das wir uns immer, wenn wir die ""notwendigen"" anderen Besichtigungen erledigt hatten schnell wieder zurück sehnten! Auch kulinarisch hat es viel zu bieten!<br/>Wir haben uns jedenfalls alle drei in die Stadt verliebt und kommen bestimmt mal wieder! Und gerne auch wieder zu Anita und Paul!<br/>Danke Euch!"
84,106759043,10/7/2016,Anna,"Anita is a sweet and caring host. It's like staying with your favourite aunt in Amsterdam. The apartment looked just as it did in the photos online and she has thought to provide everything you need like snacks, eggs, and even converters for EU plugs. The apartment is located near public transport, fantastic restaurants and many museums, all in a quiet neighbourhood. The stairs are steep but worth climbing every step for a great apartment! We'll be be back if we can! Thank you Anita!"
84,107337455,10/10/2016,Paul,"Great communication, friendly and welcoming, good insights for the local area, very nice apartment - fun and unique."

84,110081149,10/24/2016,Daniel,"We had a great holiday at Anita's apartment. The house ist quiet located, but you can reach most touristic things by foot.<br/>All in all we had a great time in Amsterdam."
84,110447067,10/26/2016,Victoria,"Anita was warm and friendly, and was excellent at keeping in touch at all times so we knew exactly what we needed to do! (This was our first air bnb experience!) the accommodation was perfect and offered a real experience of living in Amsterdam. The location was far away enough to be quiet at night time but just a short walk away from the excitement of te town centre. Thank you!"
84,111966156,11/3/2016,Carl,"This was our first time in Amsterdam and we where so happy with this accommodation. The aparment is bright, spacious and has everything we could need and a balcony included, we where lucky enough to get the sun while we where there and it shines right onto the balconys apartment . The location is perfect and a very safe neughbourhood with a daily market right beside us and a tram operating regularly into the city. Everything is in walking distance with lots of shops,restaurants and supermarkets nearby. Anita was an ideal host and made us feel at home. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a break in Amsterdam. I look forward to visiting again, thank you Anita "
84,112474852,11/6/2016,Nadine,Anita war super nett und hat immer sofort geantwortet. Die Wohnung entsprach sonst allen Vorstellungen und hat diese sogar noch übertroffen!
84,114019778,11/15/2016,Eugene,The neighborhood is really convenient.  It's surrounded by awesome restaurants and next to a really awesome market that opens daily.  Anita is really awesome and helpful as well.  She provides a full list of things to do and food suggestions.  I would definitely stay again when I visit.  
84,114509071,11/18/2016,Heidi,"AMAZING!!! Friendly, helpful hosts who went above and beyond. The place is very homey and in a great spot. We would love to stay there again.<br/>"
84,115252400,11/23/2016,Gavin,"Fantastic apartment with super host Anita! Allowed to check-in early and check out late which was greatly appreciated. <br/><br/>Anita was very welcoming and informative. As we work in the same sector, we were looking for space/quiet and that's exactly what we got! <br/><br/>The apartment was cosy, comfortable beds, good Wi-Fi and a balcony space to relax and smoke. This was our first time in Amsterdam and it was a perfect location, trams right outside however we walked everywhere! <br/><br/>We will most likely be back!! :)"
84,116125588,11/27/2016,Vicki,We loved our stay in this lovely loft in De Pijp! It's in a fantastic location situated right next to the Albert Cuyp market and near many adorable stores and restaurants. We would happily stay here again!
84,116710894,12/2/2016,Liz,"Anita was a perfect Airbnb host!  I cannot say enough about how wonderful she was to communicate with, and all of the way she went above and beyond for me and my husband.<br/>First: The apartment is exactly as pictured.  It is charming and bright, and very very clean.  The bed is big and comfortable, and the details are all there - coffee in the kitchen, plenty of linens, hair dryer, soap/shampoo in the shower, etc.  BEWARE THE STAIRS.  They are steep, and there are a lot of them :)  But we got used to it after a day and as long as you use the handrails you'll be fine.<br/>There is a very helpful binder of information in the apartment too, with instructions on all of the appliances and lots of great recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the neighborhood.  De Pijp is wonderful! It's not touristy, with lots of great little shops and restaurants to explore.  We loved Zaza's (about a 4 minute walk) and Brasserie SenT (just beyond Zaza's). <br/>My purse was stolen on the train on my way to Amsterdam - Anita and her husband were so kind and took delivery of a new credit card as well as a new wifi hotspot that we had sent to the apartment, and left them on the stairs for us.  They were very accessible, responding to messages almost immediately.  It definitely helped make a stressful situation easier to handle.  <br/>Amsterdam is an easy city to explore and feel comfortable - the public trams are fun to use and go just about everywhere.  We didn't rent bicycles, but the next time we come back I might be brave enough to try!<br/>Thank you so much Anita and Paul - we would love to stay with you again when we come back! "
84,117271288,12/5/2016,Jeremy,"A lovely apartment in a pleasant suburb within easy walking distance of central Amsterdam. Anita was a fantastic host, and very helpful with local knowledge."
84,120156989,12/8/2016,Katie,"This place was perfect for our trip to Amsterdam and the room was exactly how it was described. It was in a great location; we were able to walk everywhere we needed to, it was clean and tidy and there were lots of little added extras to make it even better, like having eggs and butter in the fridge, having shampoos and shower gels in the bathroom etc. Also the wifi we were extremely grateful for! We would 100% stay here again if we were to return to Amsterdam :) "
84,120836851,12/11/2016,Janin,Very pleasant stay<br/>Cosy apartment as shown on the picture<br/>Easy check in and check out. Anita always answered our question really quickly. Would go there again!

84,121930129,12/19/2016,Sue,"The apartment is perfectly located, only 40 mins from the airport (easily reached by public transport), and walking distance into the centre.  I experienced some great local restaurants, as well as good shopping.  The apartment was extremely clean; Anita and Paul were perfect hosts - quickly replying to queries, and offering suggestions.  The fridge/larder was well stocked with coffee, tea, wine beer, washing powder etc, all that you need to settle in.  Highly recommend this accommodation. "
84,122334667,12/22/2016,David,This is a great spot to stay in Amsterdam. Very close to a lot of attractions. Anita made sure we had all the information we needed to get around. The apartment was well equipped and I can recommend a stay in this charming apartment!

She also walked through the apartment for me. <br/><br/>Anita and her husband made sure the stay is comfortable and enjoyable! Highly recommend! "
84,126875424,1/14/2017,Rebecca,"The place was fabulous, it was clean and open and quite a good size, we weren't sure what to expect, there was two queen size beds which was a bonus, both were super comfy. Anita has the basics you need in the kitchen and travel maps and guides so you can easily make your way around, the area is very hip with some great restaurants we found and the market only one street away! If you want to get into the city it's an easy walk or if you are feeling lazy a tram takes you right to central station! "
84,128499959,1/25/2017,Omri,"Stayed here with friends for 7 wonderful days. Great location, very close to the tram station.<br/>Clean and cozy.<br/>We were surprised to find the refrigerator filled with a lot of grocerys, food and drinks.<br/>Thank you Anita and Paul for a wonderful stay!<br/>"

She left us a great folder of recommendations!<br/>The flat is beautiful, really great space with a nice quiet balcony.  It has all the amenities you would need for a great stay.<br/>It's perfectly placed in De Pijp, just round from some great restaurants and bars but in a nice quiet street.<br/>It was really nice to get to meet Anita and I heartily recommend a stay here."
84,135797702,3/6/2017,Keri,Anita was wonderful! Our stay was exactly perfect and what we hoped for based on matching our needs/desires with her accurately described apartment. 
84,136699300,3/12/2017,Meara,"Anita and Paul were wonderful hosts. They communicated very clearly and quickly, their apartment was so nice and conveniently located. We loved the liveliness and diversity of the neighborhood, and being central enough to walk to all the main tourist attractions. We strongly<br/>recommend staying at Anita and Paul's place in De Pijp to truly experience all the city has to offer. "
84,140700015,3/31/2017,Bronwyn,"Anita and Paul are truly exceptional hosts.  The apartment is a charming gem in De Pijp, and they make the experience so much more with their kind and thoughtful touches.  The neighbourhood is vibrant and local, full of cafes, markets and greenspaces.  The apartment is very comfortable and well equipped with everything you need, in excellent working order and spotlessly clean.  Anita also provides a binder full of neighbourhood details, and full instructions on the apartment workings and appliances, which is always much appreciated.  You are in easy walking distance to the museumplein, Vondelpark, or the historic center, and main tram routes are also moments away! We were lucky enough to spend a morning chatting over delicious coffee and sweets in their light filled conservatory, and it was a true pleasure to spend time with them and learn more about life in their wonderful city.  We highly recommend them as hosts!"
84,141691418,4/4/2017,Lauren,"I'm an obsessive (Hidden by Airbnb) -er. I research the hell out of everything, especially for this trip with my husband, and we couldn't have been happier with how everything worked out at Anita's AirBnB. Anita could not have been a more gracious or helpful host. We felt so taken care of while in Amsterdam. The apartment was perfect, spacious and airy, central location, no more than 15 minutes to anything, either walking or by tram. We loved the layout of the place, especially the balcony to have our evening cocktails or morning coffee. It was the first place we stayed during a 2-week trip to Europe, and it was the perfect start to an amazing vacation. Definitely stay here. Thank you for everything Anita! We hope to come visit again soon :)"
84,143264113,4/11/2017,Louise,Wonderful hosts with such lovely and cozy house.Thanks for everything you guys prepared for us.Me and my mum had a good time in Amsterdam.
84,143695604,4/13/2017,Mandi,The apartment was just as described and in a great location.  We enjoyed sitting out on the balcony with the Heineken's that were left for us on arrival! Lots of little added touches like waffles and jams. Very well equipped and it felt like the real Amsterdam experience. We would return again and recommend staying here to others :) 
84,145000987,4/17/2017,Matthew,"Great apartment, exactly as described and a perfect location in De Pijp.  The hosts were lovely and very helpful. We would not hesitate to stay again."
84,146524690,4/23/2017,Cristina,"<br/>The house of Anita and Paul is beautiful as described in the advertisement and equal to the photos shown. During our stay we have gone everyday walking to the center, museums, vondel park and everywhere we visited. Also if you fancy walking public transport is just around the corner as well as shops to rent bikes.<br/><br/>It's a great neighborhood, coming from shops, restaurants, cafes, supermarkets as well as the Albert Cuyp market just around the corner.<br/><br/>Finally the house has everything you need to enjoy your stay in Amsterdam, well equipped and with comfortable beds. My experience has been great and would repeat! Thank you Anita and Paul."
84,148203097,4/30/2017,Suna,"Ich kann jedem die Unterkunft sehr empfehlen.Tolle Wohnung,super zentral und eine sehr herzliche und tolle Gastgeberin."
84,149423422,5/4/2017,Juan,"Excelente anfitriona, es la calle paralela al Albert cuyp market, donde puedes aprovisionarte, aparte de un lidl cercano, de variedad de mariscos y pescados a buen precio y cocinarlos en su cocina con todo lo necesario. Te tiene preparado una carpeta con un mapa de sitios cercanos de interes: panadería, parada taxis, etc... muy agradable su atención, pero no es nada entrometido y te deja completamente a tu bola, eso sí, siempre muy atenta por mensajes de texto de que todo vaya bien y ayudarte en lo que pueda ( a nosotros nos reservó el taxi de vuelta al aeropuerto). La cama superior más blanda si sufres de la espalda, y si tienes dificultad para escaleras muy empinadas preparate, pero es parte del encanto. Mucha luz y el patio abierto y casa de annita esta justo dos plantas más abajo. Muy recomendable. En 15 min andando estamos en centro urbano o voldenpark con museumplein."
84,150748486,5/9/2017,Andrew,Anita's place was great! We loved everything about it! Anita was very helpful with everything from directions to suggestions on what to see while we were in Amsterdam. The location was very close to the Metro and only a short ride to city center. It was a great stay and we will definitely return! Thanks Anita&Paul!
84,151303316,5/12/2017,Kyle,Excellent hosts who went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable in the apartment and had an excellent stay in Amsterdam.

84,153464422,5/21/2017,Katharina,"Amsterdam ist mindestens eine Reise wert ! Ich war über ein verlängertes Wochenende mit meiner Mutter und meiner Tante dort. Wir haben uns alle bei Anita wie zu Hause gefühlt. Herzlicher Empfang und persönliche Verabschiedung. Sie gab uns tolle Tipps für das Wochenende, ebenfalls bzgl. der Umgebung und Sehenswürdigkeiten. Viele kleine Extras waren ebenfalls im App. enthalten ( Tee, Kaffee, Shampoo etc.), damit hatten wir gar nicht gerechnet. Obwohl wir sogar etwas zu früh waren, durften wir das App. betreten und Anita hat sich Zeit für uns genommen. Das App. ist sehr ruhig, liegt aber trotzdem sehr zentral. um die Ecke liegt direkt ein Markt der von Montag bis Samstag geöffnet hat, viele Restaurants etc. waren auch in direkter Umgebung. Wir haben außer der Grachtenfahrt alles zu Fuß unternommen und es gab keinerlei Probleme bzgl. der Entfernung.  <br/>Wir bedanken uns nochmal recht herzlich bei Anita und kommen bestimmt nochmal wieder :)"
84,154225641,5/23/2017,Nikki,"This is my second time staying at Anita's. I didn't think it was possible for my second time in De Pijp to be better than the first!!! Anita is a gracious host and was sure to keep in contact while we were en route. Her place is in a fantastic neighbourhood, close to tons of things to do. It's a great respite after long days of walking and touring. If I could rank higher than 5 stars, I would. Thank you Anita for being so lovely to my husband and I. We hope to stay with you in the future. "
84,154748258,5/26/2017,Samantha,"We loved our stay at Anita's beautiful home! The place is charming and in a great location. Anita was easy to be in contact with for check in and check out and provided information about nearby activities, food, and transportation. A wonderful stay! "

84,161991398,6/19/2017,Daniel,"I can only say good things about our stay in Anita's apartment. It was exactly as shown in the pictures, in a really cool and calm area ( not too close to the center but still close enough to walk to Dam, red light district and other major attractions. <br/>The apartment itself was clean , organized, and Anita made sure to receive us and explain us all about the interesting things in the area . <br/><br/>As said before I don't have any negative to say about our experience there. <br/><br/>Thanks Anita for everything "
84,164042763,6/26/2017,Eloise,"Anita and Paul are very welcoming and friendly. The apartment is located very close to Amsterdam city centre, easily within walking distance. If we ever get the chance to return we will definitely stay here again. "
84,164881314,6/29/2017,Cheryl,"Really nice quiet location next to a popular street market, great food, trams, a park, etc. Everything you could want. Anita was very responsive to questions and was helpful when we needed to leave our bags after check-out. The apartment is very thoughtfully appointed with cooking tools, oil, butter, spice, toast, jam, etc, so you can cook very easily. They even provided some chocolate and beer which was really appreciated."
84,166642981,7/4/2017,Lara,"Anita ha sido muy agradable con nosotros. En todo momento ha estado dispuesta a ayudarnos y cuando lo hemos necesitado lo ha hecho encantada.<br/><br/>El apartamento en mi opinión esta muy bien situado, hemos podido ir andando de un lado para otro sin ningún problema. A demás está en una zona muy animada en la que hay mercadillo y a la noche un buen ambiente para salir tranquilamente a dar una vuelta. <br/>En el piso Anita nos dejo algunas cosas para el desayuno y alguna cosa en el frigo que fue de gran ayuda. También nos recomendó sitios en los que ir a comer y nos dejo mapas y cosas que podíamos realizar.<br/><br/>Estamos realmente agradecidos a Anita y encantados con el piso."
84,167790647,7/8/2017,Julie,"Our only regret with Anita's apartment was that we couldn't stay another month-we fell in love with Amsterdam. Anita's place, as other reviews confirm, is spotlessly clean, very comfortable, and located in a wonderful part of the city. Market, museums, canals are all within an interesting walk-the Albert Cuyp market is in the next street. Anita was an unobtrusive, caring host , and we found the information folder invaluable. There were also provisions in the fridge-very welcome after a long trip. We absolutely recommend NITA's place!"
84,170175346,7/15/2017,Ryan,"What a perfect stay, from start to finish Anita was an amazing host and great help with all her local information. We were welcomed with wine and beer shown around the appartment and were even supplied with detailed maps of where to find everything.  The apartment is in the perfect location close to everything, clean and felt just like home, it was all you could hope for. I will be recommending Anita's apartment to everyone and will definetly be returning. "
84,175092193,7/28/2017,Saskia,"Wir durften 12 wundervolle Nächte in diesem Appartement verbringen & haben es von Anfang bis Ende sehr genossen. Anita war schon bei der Buchung super freundlich, hat uns tolle Tipps und eine Wegbeschreibung schon vorweg gegeben. Wir kamen leider erst abends an, aber die liebe Anita hat für uns extra ein paar Kleinigkeiten im Kühlschrank gehabt, sodass wir uns am ersten Abend noch ganz einfach was zu essen machen konnten. Die Wohnung ist mit allem was man braucht ausgestattet und hat unglaublich viel Flair. Wir kommen deshalb aufjedenfall wieder! Liebe Anita, vielen vielen Dank "
84,176908381,8/1/2017,Adrian,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam. The accomodation was exactly as described and we were made to feel very welcome and at home. Anita was extremely helpful in pointing out locations and attractions in the area. Would 100% recommend.
84,177599640,8/3/2017,Sonke,"Look no further, this place is AMAZING! Super friendly host with the most! The pijp is a cool area just outside the main centre rings (but still central). It's less touristy and you get a real Amsterdam community. The apartment is so nicely equipped, with some nice books and things, but not cluttered. Anita, the host, you cannot fault, she was super helpful and a genuinely awesome person. Have been to Amsterdam 20+ times and feel I have found my new diggs. We'll be back xxx"

84,179992727,8/9/2017,Kaley,"Anita's home was lovely! It was cozy, comfortable and well-lit. We enjoyed just relaxing the last part of our trip and her place was close to a hip part of town. Try Los Feliz and Bakers + Roasters! Anita was a great host and we would definitely recommend her home."
84,181535757,8/13/2017,Patricia,"Anita es muy atenta y cuida mucho los detalles, te hace sentir en casa desde que llegas hasta que te vas. La casa es adorable y el barrio y la zona en general genial. Repetiría y lo aconsejaría sin dudarlo."
84,182974673,8/16/2017,Dominic,Our stay in Amsterdam was literally perfect! The apartment is well-equipped and has enough room for 4 people. We really liked that it's in a quiet part of Amsterdam because in the city itself it was extremely busy.<br/>We definition recommend this apartment for everyone! 
84,184578872,8/20/2017,똘레랑스,Anita answered immediately and was very helpful in answering questions and responding very carefully.<br/>And our children loved this house too.
84,186238912,8/24/2017,Lenny,"Anita was a wonderful host and her place is exactly as pictured. It's in a very fun neighborhood full of shops, restaurants and plenty of other places to go. It is very close to public transportation, so getting anywhere around the city is very easy. We would definitely recommend it if you want to gain a more local and interesting Amsterdam experience."
84,187053680,8/26/2017,Wioletta,"Mitten im Geschehen! Diese Unterkunft ist sehr zentral gelegen und man kann alles innerhalb von 15 min erreichen. Das Viertel ""De Pijp"" ist eine Attraktion für sich und drumherum gibt es ganz viele hippe Läden. Wir verbrachten hier 3 wunderschöne Tage. Anita ist sehr herzlich und lässt keinen Wunsch ungeschehen. Bei der Ankunft erwarteten uns Plätzchen, eine wunderschöne kleine Wohnung und jede Menge Tipps. Check-in und Check-out hat prima funktioniert. 10/10 Punkten! Komme sehr gerne wieder."
84,189869201,9/3/2017,L M,This is a fantastic place to stay. Anita is one of the best hostesses we have ever met - all our needs were anticipated and taken care of beautifully.
84,191045834,9/6/2017,Rosie,"Myself and two friends stayed at Anita's flat for 3 nights whilst visiting Amsterdam for the first time in September. We can't recommend the accommodation enough. Anita was always available to help and contact us which made us feel more secure, and the apartment was so cozy :) Each morning we could easily jump on the tram into Centraal, so it was perfectly convenient for sight-seeing. Thank you for having us!"
84,191838930,9/9/2017,Devin And Sarah,"Anita's studio is the perfect place to explore Amsterdam from.  It is situated in the quieter de pijp neighborhood (which we much prefer), but is close enough that everything is still very walkable.  The unit is cozy and charming, and Anita is a great host-- very attentive and goes the extra mile to make sure your stay goes well.  Highly recommend,"
84,193294702,9/13/2017,Jack,"Anita is a very reliable person.<br/>I've never met before that kindness and helpful person.<br/>I can't say any negative words to her.<br/>Everything is 100% perfect.<br/>Location,Apartment,interior,kitchen etc...<br/>Someday I will be back to Anita's home."
84,196453117,9/23/2017,Jill,"Anita's apartment is perfect, and we loved staying there.  It's in a great location, and it's exactly as described.  As long as you can walk up those Amsterdam style stairs, you are set!  We loved staying at her place, and didn't want to leave! :-)"
84,197572592,9/26/2017,Priscilia,"Anita's place was a great little gem in the heart of the De Pipj neighborhood.  Anita was fantastic to correspond with and went out of her way to make herself available.  <br/><br/>Highlights of the apartment:<br/>- Within easy walking to great restaurants and ""Central"" Amsterdam<br/>- Cosy apartment with a fully stocked kitchen, pantry etc.<br/>- Cute little balcony to have your morning coffee<br/>- Comfortable beds and lots of linens provided<br/>- Anita left us some treats and beverages for our arrival<br/><br/>A few improvements:<br/>- There is very little storage space for bags.  Every inch of the apartment is taken up with furniture or momentos<br/>- No real hanging or folding space for clothes if you want to unpack<br/>- Steep stairs (which is pretty much every apartment in Amsterdam) but worth mentioning.  <br/><br/>All in all, this is a great place and I would highly recommend it to friends and family."
84,200052625,10/4/2017,Ricardo,"It´s an appartment clean and good equipped in an unbeatable place to go museums of the city. Anita, the hotess, is a very friendly person."

84,202663145,10/12/2017,Rigmor,"Anita and Paul are the best hosts you can find. Very accurate and friendly. The flat is large and cosy. We were 3 persons, but large enough for 4. Great with all the windows to let in the light. De Pijp is a very nice part of Amsterdam city. Good restaurants and cosy small shops. Very easy to take tram no 4 to Central town, the stop is just outside the door, 4-5 min and you are in Central city. We will for sure come back."
84,203934940,10/16/2017,Fiona,"Anita's apartment suited us perfectly in terms of it's position and amenities. Easy transport links from the airport and all around the city.

The flat is lovely and the area is perfect for those who want to be away from the tourist traps but also easily walk to the city centre. Anita was super helpful and fast at getting back to us whenever we had any questions or issues with our arrival. She was kind enough to provided us with useful guide books and refreshments for our stay. I would recommend this flat for anyone looking to stay in Amsterdam!

The room is well equipped, we managed to find everything we need during our stay. The location is very convenient too, it's just a few steps away from the tram station and the city centre is within walking distance.  I would highly recommend Anita's place."
84,226949299,1/13/2018,Emily," Anita was the perfect host. Easy to communicate with and there to greet us at the curb and help us get our bags up the Dutch stairs! The space is beautiful, bright, and clean. The neighborhood is a blast. We had everything we needed! Would highly recommend. "

84,241465995,3/9/2018,Alexia,"Logement idéal ! <br/>L'appartement est propre, très bien équipé, dans un quartier calme et bien situé. Anita nous a accueilli chaleureusement et nous a aidé à porter notre valise (c'est très appréciable dans les escaliers typiques d'Amsterdam). Elle nous a renseigné et conseillé sur le quartier, les activités et les transports avant et lors de notre arrivée.<br/>Merci pour les biscuits, les chocolats, et le joli bouquet ! Nous étions comme à la maison."
84,242984805,3/14/2018,Sabrina,"Anita and her apartment were absolutely charming!! Beautiful space with everything you could ever need. Super clean and cozy and in the perfect location (close to markets, restaurants, cafes). Anita herself was of the most help. She accommodated our delayed check in and was nothing but friendly and pleasant :) She gave tons of suggestions and maps and was right there if we needed any assistance. Would most definitely recommend!! If we ever return to Amsterdam we would stay again!"
84,245228513,3/21/2018,Phil,"My wife and I are in our late sixties but in good shape. We live in the country where it is quite and that is important for us to get a good nights sleep.<br/>   This apartment met all our requirements for a perfect getaway. The entrance is on a small side street but the apartment is on the back of the building overlooking quite private yards and gardens, we were unaware of street noise or other occupants of the building. Th bed was very comfortable.<br/>    There is a kitchen that has everything you need to prepare meals or snacks if you wish and we took full advantage of this which saved us lots of cash. We enjoyed shopping at the nearby local markets. The apartment was in a great location for us and the attractions and activities we were interested in..it is just a block from public transportation and it didn’t take us long to figure out how it all works and in a couple of days we were whizzing around like locals.<br/>   We were warned about the “stairs “ and as a builder in the United States I can tell you they are not up to code! They are steep and narrow, but we went in many other building in town that were the same so that is normal for Amsterdam. Also the apt is on the third floor but in Amsterdam they have the ground floor and then 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. So get your stair master out and give it a good workout before you go. <br/>   Paul and Anita were great host and answered any questions we had and were just very nice and friendly. the apartment was great, we will stay again if we find ourself in this lovely city ."
84,245950687,3/24/2018,Alex,"This was a perfect place for my first trip to Amsterdam. Exactly same as what you see on the pictures and very clear, perfect location, easy to communicate. It has everything you need in the studio. You can sleep like baby, you can cook yourself like your home. <br/>Anita and Paul are wonderful people that make you feel like part of family.  Anita prepared manual book show you what you need for so you can save your time looking for cafe and restaurant for each meal. You may find stair is little bit steep but why not try to be an Amsterdammer while you stay. It's fun just like riding bike in Holland. I strongly recommend to people who want to experience life of Amsterdam. You won't regret. Just go for it. <br/>한국인들을 위해서 간단히 더 적겠습니다. 호스트 두분다 아주 친절하시고 답변도 빠르시고 배려심 많으십니다.  집도 깨끗하고 편안하며 방안에 준비해놓으신 자료들도 도움이 많이 됐습니다.  계단이 너무 가파르다고 느끼실수 있지만 호텔에서 자는게 아닌 이상 네델란드에서는 일상적인 일인것 같으니 참고하세요. 위치는 완전 중심부는 아니지만 그래서 더 조용하고 좋았던것 같습니다.  대신 하이네켄 박물관과 반고흐 미술관 국립미술관 등은 가깝습니다. 근처 자전거 샵에서 렌트하면 어디든 간단하게 다녀올수 있으니 추천드립니다."
84,247614867,3/29/2018,Maria,"Anita is the most wonderful, generous host.  The space was perfect and in a good location, convenient to all that Amsterdam has to offer.  We were able to walk to all attractions without any problem.  As a matter of fact, one of the best things to do is simply stroll the canals and take in the beautiful scenery."
84,248741195,4/1/2018,Erin,"there were maps, books, any information you could have possibly needed! full kitchen amenities including olive oil, balsamic vin and spices. knew what we needed before we needed it. beautiful light filled loft studio in historic neighbourhood. what does this mean in beautiful (Website hidden by Airbnb) lift, authentic stairs!...that anita graciously handled our luggage. she’s like superwoman. tons of restaurants, local daily market nearby..walkable to dam square. highly recommend!"

84,252813505,4/12/2018,Genes,"Anita é uma anfitriã maravilhosa. Desde o primeiro momento nos sentimos muito bem recebidos por ela. A geladeira tinha cervejas, uma garrafa de vinho e chás. Além de ela ter nos deixado chocolates, biscoitos e minis stroppwaffles. O apartamento é maravilhoso, idêntico ao anúncio é super bem equipado. A localização é ótima. Ao lado do Albert Cuyp Market, próximo a diversos restaurantes, pontos de tram, supermercado e a pé se consegue acessar vários dos principais pontos turísticos de Amsterdam. Recomendo."
84,254338098,4/16/2018,Elad,"We were in Anita's apartment for 4 nights and we had a great time: Anita is a charming hostess, she gave us tips, a map with points of interest and restaurants, the apartment itself had a lot of delicious surprises, the location of the apartment was simply excellent, we loved the neighborhood very much. In short, it was simply amazing and I also recommend others to stay in her apartment. Thank you Anita for amazing hosting"
84,254783077,4/18/2018,Dshamilya,"We travelled as a couple to Amsterdam and stayed for two nights in Anita's studio. The studio is very well located in a cool part of the town called ""De Pijp"" which we absolutely adored. You can reach everything pretty fast by tram, bicycle or even by feet, but you're still not too close to the typical touristic places  (which we absolutely enjoyed). <br/><br/>The studio is bright, clean and also big for Amsterdam ""circumstances"". It has everything you need (and probably more). The kitchen is very well equipped, we actually didn't use it because we had to follow the amazing food recommendations we got from Anita. <br/><br/>Overall we really enjoyed our stay in Anita's and Paul's studio and wouldn't want to stay in any other place if we're coming back to Amsterdam."
84,255695921,4/21/2018,Mary,"Wonderful spot to use as a base for exploring this side of Amsterdam.  A bit noisy at times from the courtyard, but settled down by the time we went to bed. Would definitely stay here again."
84,257161657,4/25/2018,Thomas,Die Unterkunft war perfekt (und wie beschrieben). Anita war ein super Gastgeber und extrem freundlich.
84,258099555,4/28/2018,Andrea,"Nossa estadia no Studio da Anita foi ótima! Ele é super bem equipado com cafeteira, microondas, lava-louças, lava-roupas, etc, e também tem uma boa climatização para os dias frios de Amsterdam. O bairro é cheio de restaurantes e cafeterias, e caminhando uns 10min estamos no Museu Van Gogh. A Anita é muito simpática e gentil, nos passando informações turísticas e de transporte. Acertamos na escolha!"
84,259663857,5/1/2018,Laura,Die Wohnung von Anita liegt perfekt gelegen in Amsterdam. Ruhig und trotzdem sehr dicht am Leben vom Amsterdam.<br/>Die Wohnung war sehr sauber.<br/>Anita begrüßte uns herzlich bei unserer Ankunft und gab uns einen kleinen Überblick über die Gegend.<br/>Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen.

Close to the tram and also walkable to multiple attractions. Anita is quick to respond, animated and full of joy. Her personalized tips and warm hospitality round out this spot to truly make it one of a kind! We would absolutely recommend as well as stay there again."
84,263221377,5/11/2018,John,"Anita has got to be the best host we've ever met.<br/><br/>Anita, Thank you so much for making our experience in Amsterdam so enjoyable.<br/>You went above and beyond reasonable expectations in helping us maximise our visit.<br/><br/>Your apartment was so very comfortable and relaxing, and your suggestions and assistance was so much appreciated.<br/>Location was perfect, quiet but so close to the centre, and with so many places to eat and visit close by."
84,267255399,5/21/2018,Sabine,Very good location outside of the Center. With our family we were verry happy to stay in this area which is a bit quiter.<br/>Anita and her housband are lovely people. Giving very good tips. Thank you for this great stay.
84,268444957,5/25/2018,Chris And Jonathan,"The apartment is exactly as promised and does not disappoint.  The stairs are absolutely amazing (not for the elderly or infirm - we just about managed!) and worth a visit for them alone. The flat has everything you could wish for, and Anita has added so many food and drink extras, some of which we didn't even discover until our last day!  It is in a truly brilliant location.  We walked everywhere but the tram is excellent too.  Lots of restaurants nearby, and food shops to hand.  We loved every minute."
84,269913002,5/28/2018,Meike,"We’ve had an amazing weekend at Anita’s place. From the beginning she was very thoughtful, easy to communicate with and provided us with a perfect description of how to find her place. The apartment was just as in the pictures, the beds are big and comfy and the balcony was an extra plus on the sunny weekend. The area is great and Anita’s tips of local restaurants and bars were exactly what we were looking for. Can only recommend Anita’s place and would definitely go back again."
84,271123407,5/31/2018,Caroline,This is a lovely clean and bright apartment with great space. Our hosts were fantastic and friendly. We got great instructions on how to get to the apartment from the airport. We stayed 3 nights and we couldn't have been happier. The tram line is a 2 minute walk and very easy access to Dam Square and Rembrandt Square. Very easy to get around the city. The Heineken experience is within walking distance. We walked from Rembrandt Square to the apartment in 10 minutes. The apartment is great and suited us perfect. A lot of narrow steep stairs to climb to apartment so you need to be able for heights and stairs.
84,272392770,6/3/2018,Lukas,Amazing hosts and location. Can recommend to anyone!
84,273411563,6/6/2018,Manuel,Sehr nette Wohnung in bester Lage. Anita ist äußerst hilfsbereit. Sie gab uns viele nützlicheTipps für unseren Aufenthalt in Amsterdam.

She gave plenty of suggestions of what to do and where to visit. She even left a bottle of prosecco in our room when she found out it was one of our birthdays! The accommodation was very clean, just as advertised, very stylish, and had all of the essentials such as a washing machine, dishwasher, and pressure cooker. It was in a lovely area with several restaurants nearby, as well as a supermarket and a park. Overall we had a great stay, and would highly recommend!"

84,317346753,9/2/2018,Francesca,"E' un abitazione molto accogliente situata in una zona centrale molto tranquilla. Inoltre la proprietaria è veramente gentile e disponibile. Unici difetti l'accesso all'alloggio attraverso due rampe di scale piuttosto ripide e la mancanza in cucina del lavandino. Abbiamo alloggiato in quattro persone per tre notti e, non avendo cucinato, è risultata comunque perfetta.  E' comunque presente una lavastoviglie."

Anita war schon bei der Buchung sehr gerichtet, sehr sauber, super praktisch und gleichzeitig sehr gemütlich. Wir haben uns sofort heimich gefühlt. Das Studio liegt in einem sehr schönenViertel in Amsterdam mit vielen tollen Restaurants, Bars und Geschäften.<br/>Wir sind das gesamte Wochenende zufuß durch die Stadt, viele der Sehenswürdigkeiten sind sehr schnell zu erreichen. Aber man hat auch immer die Möglichkeit mit der Tram oder der Metro zu fahren. <br/>Anita erkundigte sich nach der Hälfte unseres Aufenthaltes nach unserem befinden. Am Tag der Abreise konnten wir unser Gepäck nach dem Auszug bei ihr unter stellen um den Tag noch in der Stadt zu verbringen. <br/>Alles in allem war es ein Wunderschöner Städtetrip und wir sind sehr glücklich über unsere Unterkunft gewesen!"

Anita was a very friendly and helpful host."
84,334865181,10/10/2018,Lorraine,"Anita's home is located in the quiet neighborhood called De Pijp. Don't let the quiet fool you though, it is full of restaurants, bars, close to public transport (we preferred taking the tram which was an excellent transportation), there's a laundry mat nearby (but you won't need it; the studio has this and a dryer).  <br/>On to the actual review of the studio:<br/>For the kitchen:  it is equipped with a dishwasher, laundry washer/dryer, detergent for both dishwasher and laundry, small fridge, an electronic stove/griddle, water kettle (electric), microwave/oven combo, toaster, utensils, cooking pots and pans, 4-persin table for supper, glasses, plates and so much more.<br/>For the bathroom: standing shower/toilet (it's common I believe in these parts, our Belgium AirBnB was the same set-up), shampoo, toilet paper (extra is available if you run out), shower curtain, cleaning supplies, conditioner, shower soap, towels.  <br/>For the beds/living room: the were 2 beds, one in the upper attic, and ours was just below it, the sheets were freshly laundered, the bed was super comfortable, the pillows were great as well, there was a couch with pillows as well as an extra blanket, a coffee table, and 2 chairs in case you wish to read Anita's collection of books.<br/>There's also a small balcony which we used as well, overlooking other buildings and their respective balconies. <br/>But, do note, as is typical with Netherlands buildings, there's stairs. Anita's studio was on the top floor so yes there were stairs LOL. Overall, we loved our stay and will definitely be coming back if it is available again<br/> Will also recommend to people we know!"

She greeted us upon our arrival and gave us a brief introduction to the neighborhood. <br/><br/>The studio apartment is on the top floor of a  dutch house (via steep amsterdam steps). It is very well located (approximately 20-30 mins walk to major attractions, and there are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood. <br/><br/>The studio was well equipped for our short stay. There was a (easy to operate) convection stove, microwave, coffee machine and simple cooking utensils for us to make breakfasts. We have definitely enjoyed the decaf coffee in the mornings.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend Anita's place for couples/ friends/ small families."

There were even EU-American chargers available for our use, which I thought was such a nice touch. If you’re hungry when you get in: eggs, crackers and jam, and delicious stroopwaffles were also provided. The location is perfect and close to walk or transit anywhere in the city. Honestly, we had no complaints. Everything was clean, convenient, and cute. Anita was a lovely and kind host, and makes herself available for anything you would need with fast communication. Absolutely loved our stay!"
84,404796364,1/25/2019,Rachel,"Anita’s place made our entire Amsterdam stay. She is so kind and hospitable and the apartment is PERFECT and located within walking distance or short bus ride to the center of the city. <br/><br/>Our room was lovely and had so many thoughtful touches like a guide to the city as well as tremendous food recommendations, a little kitchenette and the bed was so comfortable. <br/><br/>We would LOVE to stay here again. We felt so at home. Thank you again Anita!"

84,413869672,2/18/2019,Stephany,Anita was a wonderful host. She provided very valuable information for our trip. The Airbnb is in a great location with lots to do around and very close to many attractions. The only semi downside are the stairs but that is expected in Amsterdam but be prepared to climb. Loved the layout of the Airbnb and it had everything we needed including a washer. Highly recommend this place. Would stay again in a heart beat.
84,415286076,2/22/2019,Andrew,"I would highly recommend this apartment. The location is just perfect as it is relatively close to the centre yet has its own distinct identity and feel; plenty of places to sample good quality food and it is quiet and safe too. Anita is the perfect host; friendly, available to assist and informative. I would have no hesitation in booking again when in Amsterdam. First class."
84,417758023,2/28/2019,Layne,"This is an amazing space and Anita was a perfect host. The space is very clean and the De Pijp neighborhood was perfect for us. Steep steps like everywhere in Amsterdam but once you climb to the top floor, you’ll find the most charming space. Would stay again!"
84,418923492,3/3/2019,Tara,"Anita was fantastic, she was very accommodating with our check in, 10pm and helpful with checkout. The flat it self was perfect for our short break.

84,425395723,3/18/2019,Nisamar,Nos gusto mucho la casa. Muy acogedora y con todos los servicios disponibles. Cerca del centro. De fácil acceso. Muy recomendable.

84,429204944,3/27/2019,Andrew,Great place to stay in a lovely location.  Would stay here again
84,432530092,4/4/2019,Jana,"Anita's charming space is in the perfect location, just a block away from a large market which we went to nearly everyday for amazing food.  The space is small but not so small you feel cramped.  Similar in size to a suite style hotel room but so much more charming.  The balcony overlooks the back yards of the rest of the block and has a courtyard feel and is a nice view.  The space was clean and she left many recommendations for us, as well as a jar of stroopwaffles for us to enjoy and many other amenities.  Anita was available whenever we needed her and was quick to respond.  She let us drop off our bags prior to check-in so we could go enjoy the city without the luggage.  Just a lovely experience."
84,433891649,4/7/2019,Erica,"Anita’s place is great an you do not need anything else. Beautiful clean, close to so many things and all transport. Her communication is great and she is a beautiful person. We will treasure the experience in Amsterdam due to Anita’s lovely unit."
84,435024693,4/9/2019,Kelly,"First: BOOK. THIS. PLACE. It is the best experience I've ever had on AirBnB, from start to finish. Anita was immediately so communicative *before* we even got there, sending us recommendations and directions. In person, she's even better. She got us perfectly settled in right when we arrived. We all agreed we'd love to hang out with Anita because she is the coolest. As for the place, it's in the best location in Amsterdam. The home is so cute and lovely and beautifully designed. The beds are the most comfortable beds I've slept in (even more than my one at home!) All the amenities  for cooking & eating are available, and the shower is big, which was so nice after traveling for a long while. The balcony is so nice to have for a cup of coffee in the morning, or a drink at night. Anita also set out stroopwafels for us which we devoured! oops! Can't wait to be back and will absolutely be coming back to stay at Anita's place. Thanks Anita!!!!!"
84,436525012,4/13/2019,Adele,"A charming studio indeed!  Anita is a gracious host, the location is great with so many shops and restaurants and the tram close by. The studio is nicely furnished and very comfortable. Thanks Anita and Paul!!"
84,439471913,4/19/2019,Esper,"Wonderful location, charming place!"
84,443528818,4/26/2019,Sally,We had a great time at Anitas Place. <br/>She was very helpfull and easy to communicate with.<br/>Great Market and Restaurants in walking distance! The Apartment was very nice. The three of us had plenty of space. <br/>We will be back. 
84,445403096,4/29/2019,Paul,"In summary, this is a fantastic apartment kept spotlessly clean in a bohemian area of town with a great host. We would stay here again when in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>In detail, the apartment has a lovely feel with a comfortable balcony that overlooks the gardens at the back. This is a nice little suntrap to have a chat and plan where to go on your stay. The bed is very comfortable and the table and kitchenette area provides you the ability to have a nice breakfast or snack. The location of de pijp is ideal for visiting the city, about 40 minutes to walk in or trams available on your doorstep, although with the market and amenities of de pijp you may want to spend some time locally. <br/>Be aware the stairs are true Amsterdam stairs (basically think of a step ladder) but then once at the top the room is tranquil given that it is a city location. <br/>Anita takes great care of you and offers you the chance to leave luggage if you are arriving early or leaving late and she will take a deal of care in giving you tailored information about the city and very clear instructions on how to get in on public transport from the airport. Great place thank you Anita"
84,446850078,5/2/2019,Julia,"Anita was so very helpful in all aspects of visiting Amsterdam, whether it was the transportation or food, etc, and it was very valuable. She was flexible for us but communicated the whole time, and was wonderful. Thank you Anita, for a wonderful introduction to Amsterdam, much appreciated!<br/><br/>Julia"
84,449297896,5/6/2019,Andrei,"The apartment was wonderful! Everything so cozy and tidy. A bunch of fresh tulips and mini strop waffles on the table created a special “like home” atmosphere))<br/><br/>Anita and Paul are perfect hosts, so hospitable and careful. We spend very good time together during the breakfast before our leaving.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is very comfortable. Near the apartment is a market and a lot of good cafes and restaurants with high ratings.<br/><br/>Happy that have chosen this place, really wan to come back. Thanks a lot!"
84,451794447,5/12/2019,Justine,"Anita est une hôte attentive et réactive aux demandes. Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans son appartement, qui est idéalement situé pour visiter Amsterdam. Le quartier est agréable, calme, avec des restaurants aux alentours tout pour passer un bon séjour, grâce aux bonnes adresses d’Anita !"
84,456318101,5/21/2019,Melissa,Anita’s apartment is in such a great location. It’s very close to many tram/bus stops and is in walking distance to SO many amazing places. There are also some truly wonderful restaurants very close by.
84,458496478,5/26/2019,Christina,"Anita was great!  Very good communication and even gave us exact transit info and directions on how to get to her place.  She had the best mini waffles on the table and coffee, tea, sparkling water and wine available.  We had a great stay at her studio!"
84,460386953,5/29/2019,Claudia,"Es handelt sich um einlichtdurchflutetes, ruhiges Appartment, das alles hat, was man für einen Kurzurlaub benötigt. Alles ist mehr oder weniger fußläufig erreichbar, so dass man völlig frei bei der Tagesgestaltung ist."
84,462718355,6/2/2019,Jean,En plus d'un très bon accueil l'appartement était conforme à la description faite sur le site. L'appartement est très bien situé. Nous avons passé un très bon week en famille <br/>avec 2 enfants de 6 et 9 ans qui ont adoré dormir sur la mezzanine. Seul petit bémol il n'y a pas d'évier dans l'appartement. En conclusion nous garderons un très bon souvenir de notre passage à Amsterdam.
84,464752880,6/6/2019,Martin,"Great locale with all sorts of shops around the corner, great and informative host! Everything you'd need was already in the appartment"
84,469306119,6/14/2019,Molly,"My husband and I absolutely loved staying at Anita’s place. We loved the quiet neighborhood the apartment was in; it was within walking distance to everything we needed. Anita has wonderful information in a binder that includes things to do and places to eat and drink. A lot of people commented on the stairs, but it’s really not bad at all. Just take your time when going down the stairs with your luggage! The mattress was super comfortable which made it difficult to get up each morning! When we return to visit Amsterdam, we will definitely stay here again."
84,472213179,6/19/2019,Catherine,"I stayed here with my husband and our two adolescent daughters, ages 14 and 16. We absolutely loved the apartment and neighborhood. Anita is a warm and welcoming hostess and stocked the apartment with everything we could possibly need. She also checked in with us after the first day to see how we were doing and ask if we had any questions. My girls loved sleeping in the loft space. The little balcony is charming and the apartment is filled with lights due to big windows and a skylight in the bathroom. We felt like locals staying here!"
84,474503949,6/23/2019,Ailie,We had a great stay over the Carnivale Brettanomyces weekend. Anita was a wonderfully helpful host.<br/><br/>We’d absolutely stay here again. It’s a lovely apartment in a great location and the stairs feel less daunting the more you use them. Honest! :)
84,476505767,6/26/2019,Stephanie,We had such a lovely stay at Anita's place. Great location to do everything we wanted. Would definitely recommend.
84,477888202,6/29/2019,Deborah,"Anita’s place is awesome and Anita went out of her way to make sure we had a great stay. I would absolutely recommend her place! It’s an adorable Dutch apartment with everything clean and in working order. The beds were large and comfortable and the little balcony was great to sit out on. Anita was so welcoming and helpful to our family. <br/><br/>Also this is a great location! De Pijp is a great neighborhood away from the really touristy areas but still walking distance to everything. There are tons of restaurants nearby and also it’s a block away from the Albert Cuypmarket where you can get street food, fresh bread, cheese, fruit, etc. It’s also very close to Museumplein where the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum are.<br/>I wish we could have stayed longer!"
84,484046644,7/8/2019,Tim,"Amazing location, amazing touches and style for the apartment too! Anita was so kind and welcoming!"
84,486083466,7/12/2019,Lukas,Me and my friend really enjoyed the stay in the apartment. The open and light room was perfect for us and it is very near the center. We’ve reached every Museum and attraction  by foot. In the end a really successful city trip!
84,493842522,7/23/2019,Jaime,Anita was a great host.  Her communication was excellent and she offered a lot of tips.  The apartment was clean and had everything that you needed.  It is a short walk to the tram to get into the hustle and bustle but you could walk if you wanted to.  There is a laundry mat and a park close by.  A great stay.  Thank you Anita.
84,498710264,7/30/2019,Lynn,"Anita is a great host and I can only reiterate all the great reviews for this apartment. <br/>Clean, safe, roomy, great location, helpful hosts, near public transportation and  restaurants, and grocery and take out stores."

84,504243338,8/7/2019,Adeline,"Nous avons passés un excellent séjour à quatre chez Anita. Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés ! Très bonne communication (avant le séjour et pendant), elle communiquait avec nous en français par message et aussi lors de l'accueil dans le logement.<br/>Vous y trouverez tout ce dont vous avez besoin ! Très bien équipé, il y a vraiment tout ce qui est nécessaire. L'endroit est propre et spacieux. Vous êtes proche à pied du centre.<br/>Le quartier est vivant avec beaucoup de restauration. Juste à côté il y a le marché Albert Cuyp.  <br/>Anita et son conjoint sont des hôtes très accueillant et prévenant, des petites gaufres locales nous attendaient sur la table ainsi que quelques boissons le frigo. Vous pouvez compter sur eux si vous avez des questions ou besoin de conseils.<br/>Nous avons pu laisser nos bagages chez eux lorsque nous avons quitté le logement à 11h afin de profiter encore de la ville avant notre départ vers 16h."
84,507915792,8/12/2019,Rebecca,"第一次遇到房東準備了這麼多的食物給我們,冰箱有二瓶海尼根,一瓶白洒,蛋,很多奶油及果醬,還有荷蘭的特色餅乾,現磨咖啡,可可,茶包,濃湯包...還貼心幫忙把行李搬到4樓,民宿距離各景點及地鐵都步行可到,廚房有微波爐,烤麵包機,唯一較不方便的是沒有洗衣機,不過附近有自助洗衣機,若不想手洗的話,離中央火車站步行約35分鐘,邊逛邊走當市區觀光不算遠,不想走也有方便的捷運可搭,住起來很舒服,很推薦哦!"
84,509850819,8/15/2019,Sebastian,Empfehlenswerte Unterkunft!
84,513287558,8/19/2019,Olivier,"Un quartier superbe entre rues résidentielles pleines de charme et de verdure et places et grandes rues animées par des bars, restaurants et marché très agréables. <br/><br/>Un appartement très mignon, dans un style scandinave reposant, avec balcon donnant sur les cours intérieures des immeubles.

Additionally you are very close to the Albert-Cupy-Market, where we had a stroopwafel for breakfast every day.<br/>All in all very recomendable."
84,517024489,8/25/2019,Andreas,We had a lovely stay in this typical amsterdam apartement. Anita is a very nice host with a lot of tipps about Amsterdam and De Pijp (direct neighborhood). The apartment is equipt with everything you need and more (very tasty Stroopwafels ).

84,533322084,9/21/2019,Christine,"A super cute space in De Pijp. I stayed by myself, but I think this would be a great place to come with someone else. It was only 30ish min from the airport and really accessible to everything else in the city as well. Anita was an amazing host and communicated very clearly on everything I would need to know. She even has a binder waiting for you at the space with recommendations for sightseeing, restaurants, bars - you name it. Her attention to detail really gave me one less thing to worry about in planning this trip. Would highly recommend staying here."

84,543745708,10/8/2019,Nikita,The apartments are located on the 3rd floor in the house where Anita lives.  Nearby is the Heiniken Museum.  The apartments are well maintained with a wonderful combination of interior details.  Unless there is not enough stove and sink in the kitchen.  But in general I recommend.  Anita takes care of and takes care of everything and is always ready and open for dialogue.  Beautiful sociable woman. Nikita.

Прекрасное расположение, рядом есть рынок где можно купить сыр по хорошей цене и вкусные печеньки. До центра спокойно можно дойти пешком.

We can recommend Mano Mano restaurant, not wholly vegetarian, but had delicious options. The White Swan was amazing for food and catered considerately to our friend with food allergies."
84,558691742,11/3/2019,Thibault,Rustig gelegen en toch dicht bij verschillende leuke bars en restaurantjes.
84,563544001,11/13/2019,Sonia,"El alojamiento tiene una excelente ubicación, es posible llegar caminando a gran parte de los atractivos turísticos.

84,565084974,11/17/2019,Emily,"Anita’s space was perfect for our trip! Plenty of room, everything we needed, and close to everything! Will definitely stay again if I’m back in Amsterdam! My mom and I had a great time."
84,567031975,11/21/2019,Robyn-Leigh,"Anita was a fabulous host! Everything you need is in this beautiful little haven tucked away in a great location in Amsterdam! Made my first visit her so comfortable and easy, would definitely stay here again! Can't recommend enough!"
84,569022196,11/25/2019,Jody,"What a perfect place to stay! Anita was an outstanding host, helped with travel tips well before our arrival and went above and beyond in making our stay personal with unique touches. The apartment is very close to transit, is clean, well-appointed, and near wonderful shops and sights. Worked quite well for our family of four (with two young kids), would highly recommend!"
84,569943649,11/28/2019,Carlos,"This is a very charming place on the top floor of a clean and quiet house. It provides<br/>everything needed to enjoy the fabulous city of Amsterdam. The bed is very comfortable, there is a nice little balcony that we would have enjoyed more if there had been less rain. The bathroom is spacious with a nice skylight  for illumination and ample ventilation. It was easy to access and control the thermostat for the perfect room temperature. The loft has many thoughtful touches for travelers, including numerous guide books, maps, a power converter, blackout blinds, plenty of recreational and serious reading material, and kitchen basics like coffee, tea, sugar, salt, and pepper.<br/><br/>Amsterdam offers plenty to explore and therefore I can't imagine anyone spending too much time indoors. But after a long day of exploring it was great to be able to come back to this cozy  loft for some relaxation. The location is close to trams and buses with a high 'walkability' score. There is a grocery store 2 minutes walk away (note: it only accepts cash and the Maestro credit card, which was a big surprise at the cash register) and the Albert Cuyp market is in the next street. We especially enjoyed coffee and fresh-from-the-oven chocolate banana bread at nearby De Groentemeesters bakery/coffeehouse on Nicolaas Berchemstraat, 4.<br/><br/>Anita is super friendly and caring, offering plenty of information (even before arrival!!) about the city. She was very accommodating to our check-in needs. I almost feel bad that we didn't have more reasons to contact her as she is a very nice person to talk to. We are looking forward to returning here when the weather is a little better than the three late days in November when we visited.<br/>~"
84,572293564,12/2/2019,Millie,"Having been to Amsterdam in 3 different Airbnb's over the past few years, this was by far the best! Located in a lovely neighbourhood and surrounded by bars, shops, cafes and restaurants with access to the main square so easy by tram or short walk. The apartment itself is spacious and decorated with so much character, whilst having all the necessary amenities and more. Extremely comfy bed, powerful hot shower, and excellent heating for keeping warm in the winter. Anita is the best host, so relaxed and welcoming and always checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed. A superb apartment!"
84,575060439,12/9/2019,Daryn,"A warm welcome and really friendly, more than happy to help with anything. Nice place and has all the essentials. Even sent her husband out to collect us when we were havin trouble finding the street."

Not to mention she’s extremely welcoming and friendly.<br/>Location is great and very helpful tips as to how to get there.<br/>I stayed here with my sister for 3 nights and the apartment was perfect for that. The room is at the top floor so lots of stairs but very typical of Holland so no problem for us. The room was smaller than first expected but still lots of room for the both of us and we didn’t get on top of each other at all!<br/>I’ve had such a wonderful weekend and would 100% stay here again xxx"

84,614470052,3/5/2020,Samar,"Out of the 7 years I have been traveling and using Airbnb, Anita's been my favourite person and place to stay at. Her home was perfect--cute, clean, chic, and considerate. (Yay, alliteration!) She was incredibly quick re: communication. After meeting her and being let in, my friends and I spent a good amount of time joking about wanting to be adopted by her. Needless to say, I would highly recommend her and her place. :)"
84,615525857,3/8/2020,Jenna,"This apartment is to die for! It is very quaint and stylised, there is plenty of room while having a cosy feel to it. Anita and Paul are extremely friendly and helpful while having lots of tips and advice about the city. The location is fantastic with lots of vibrant bars and restaurants. It was very clean and there were plenty of fresh towels and blankets. The balcony is lovely for sitting out on when it’s dry!"
84,617209241,3/12/2020,Joshua,Anita was the most fantastic host going above and beyond to make sure we were all okay and even carried some bags up to the apartment for us! The apartment was sparkling clean and very true to the pictures. Stayed here with my partner and a friend and it was plenty roomy enough for the 3 of us. The location was outstanding and I highly recommend it. Easy walking distance to anything you could wish for in Amsterdam but also just far enough out of the hectic tourist areas. All in all the perfect Amsterdam stay cant recommended it highly enough!
84,617901491,3/14/2020,Gökçe,"Anita and Paul good host, Paul met with us at home and describe what we need at home and around by Anitas’ notes. We feel like at home, maybe see you another time. thank you :)"

Есть мини кухня что очень удобно(единственное без плиты) но она нам и не нужна была. Квартире в хорошем спокойном районе, но можно спокойно пешком обойти весь центр. Из аэропорта ехать примерно час.

We received a warm reception from Rogier on our arrival who showed us the ropes and made some EXCELLENT recommendations for local places to eat at and see. Having visited Amsterdam on many occasions, this is without a doubt the best located place I have stayed. Everything this incredible city has to offer is in walking distance, the apartment is beautifully presented, comfotable clean and secure and it represents far better value than any hotel you could get in the same location for the money. Henrike and Rogier were fantastic hosts who were only too happy help me with questions I had before arriving and responsive to any queries during our stay. Thank you both for your part in making this trip a super special one! "

She has a great and clean apartment in a very convenient location. The house is very old but the apartment all modern and comfortable. 5 minutes walk to Central Station and Dam Square. Very quiet place. Near a good supermarket and many souvenir shops and coffee shops. The apartment can accommodate 4-5 people if you use the sofa bed in the living room. From the apartment the narrow stairs you can climb to the small terrace. Keep in mind that in the main bedroom which is located in the attic, is no door, and it will have to climb up the narrow and steep stairs. The Wifi was very fast. Everything was just wonderful. Thank you Henrik!"

74,54659971,11/22/2015,Robyn,The perfect property in the perfect location! Hendrike was very helpful and made our experience a relaxed one with her communication and instructions. The apartment was immaculate with all the conveniences included. Didn't get to use the roof terrace because of the weather but it would be beautiful in the summer. Would highly recommend this little gem tucked in the hustle and bustle of the city centre. 
74,55817742,12/6/2015,Janice,"Henrike was a fantastic host and made us all feel very welcome in the apartment.  She showed us everything we needed and even had some maps printed out for us.  <br/>The apartment was beautiful and extremely clean,  the pictures really do not do it justice.  The beds are very comfortable as is the sofa.  <br/>We did have a look up on the roof terrace but it was far too cold for us to stay up there for too long, but I can imagine sitting relaxing up there on a summers day. <br/>I will definitely stay here again when we visit Amsterdam!!<br/>Thank you for having us Henrike we had a fantastic time. <br/>"
74,59982541,1/17/2016,Keiron,"Our stay was amazing!  Hendrike & Rogier treated us like they had known us for years, and the Penthouse was in an ideal location.  Located literally in the middle of the city in Amsterdam, it was ideal for whatever activities you wanted to get involved in (partying, drinking at the bars, going to clubs, shopping, tourist activity, red light district, etc.).  Everything was within a 10 minute walk (mostly less).  <br/><br/>The selection of restaurants was also very nice.  The location of the apartment is great, because it is on the top floor of the building, and has rooftop access with a lounge area on the roof.  Unfortunately it was snowing during our stay, so we couldn't enjoy that aspect of the place, but I will definitely be coming back to stay here, next time my stay will be longer for sure.  Amazing place that I would most definitely recommend to anyone planning to visit Amsterdam!"
74,60506118,1/24/2016,David,"The apartment is just great. Perfect also;like in our case, for 4 people. It's located in plain center 2 minutes walk from the Dam and from central station.

74,61771163,2/8/2016,Çağatay,We stayed their home for 3 days. It was very comfortable and restful. The house is located in central of Amsterdam so you can seriously go where ever you want by walk. All was good however the hause was cold. I think they have heating problem but there was enough blankets for us. Also thanks a lot for Rogier he is so kind and helpful.

It was really kind, that she got a Prosecco bottle for us.  <br/>All in all, the stay was comfortable and I would recommend Hendrike's apartment. Thank you very much! :)"

74,90125081,7/31/2016,Elisabeth,"Hendrike is a very friendly and welcoming host. The flat is absolutely lovely, it's confortable and decorated with taste. The cherry on the cake is the cosy rooftop terrasse, with everything you need for a drink, a bbq or even a candlelight diner! <br/>Hendrike made us feel welcomed with a nice bottle of Prosecco and gave us the necessary informations to get started in Amsterdam.<br/>We felt like home and we're looking forward to come back !<br/>"
74,94234527,8/15/2016,Oliver,Wonderful apartment. Great location. Will definitely be back. Thanks Hendrike.
74,95923893,8/21/2016,Kristine,"My family and I loved the place. Very bright, clean and central to all sites. The roof top deck is amazing.  The host is lovely.  We highly recommend this flat."
74,102767529,9/19/2016,Dennis,Perfect place to stay in Amsterdam.<br/>Nice and central flat.
74,104007711,9/25/2016,Christian,Best experience EVER in Amsterdam. I'll be back for sure!!
74,105568947,10/2/2016,Damir,"One of the best travel experiences we have ever had. Henrike gave a bottle of champaign to welcome us. Staying with her was super chill and nice. Perfect location! Amazing apartment (same as in photos)! All rules and regulations were clearly laid out, her communication was clear throughout.  Thank you for everything!"
74,108435623,10/16/2016,Paul,"Von der Schlüssübernahme bis zur Schlüsselübergabe waren Hendrike und Rogier sehr nett und unkompliziert und haben uns wertvolle Tipps für Amsterdam mit auf den Weg gegeben. Die Wohnung ist tasächlich wie auf den Fotos eingerichtet, sieht in Echt aber noch schicker aus. <br/>Absolut empfehlenswert, vielen Dank!"
74,112446185,11/6/2016,Clara,"Hôte très agréable, appartement top et tres bien situé ✔️"
74,116987364,12/4/2016,Krystof,"Excellent stay. The location is just off the main high street and public transport access within a few 100 yards. On arrival I was greeted by Hendrikes partner. Lovely chap and gave me a brief tour of the apartment and gave me some handy advice on where to dine out. I later returned as I was early checking in however was notified when I could settle down which was a short time after and well before the standard check in time. This was brilliant as I only had a few hours sleep the night before due to work and very early departure from the UK. <br/><br/>The apartment was very clean, and has everything you need. The roof top terrace is a nice touch, a little tricky getting on to but with care it was not an issue. <br/><br/>Everyone was very happy and very comfortable. The noise from a high street was not an issue for me personally but for an early nights sleep may be difficult. The upstairs bedroom is cold but again this did not bother me and is easily fixable. <br/><br/>Overall great stay and would recommend to anyone wanting a few days away in a beautiful apartment in a beautiful city. <br/><br/>Thanks again both.<br/>"
74,126958792,1/15/2017,ניצן,The apartment was exactly like the pictures. Everything was clean and lovely. Great location! Hope to come and stay again in hendrike's apartment :)

74,148178574,4/30/2017,Franziska,"Wir haben 3 Tage in Amsterdam verbracht. Es hat uns richtig gut gefallen. Die Lage der Wohnung ist sehr gut. Man ist direkt im Zentrum. Flughafen-Hauptbahnhof. Dann zu Fuß noch ca. 7 min zur Wohnung. Man kann zu Fuß schon viel erreichen. Fahrräder mieten ist aber noch besser. Kann man gleich neben an mieten. Luggage Depot ebenfalls gleich nebenan. War super, da wir schon um 10:00 die Wohnung verlassen haben und erst um 21:00 Uhr abflogen.  Bestens geeignet für 4 Leute. Nette Dachterrasse. Alles sauber und perfekt. Wir haben nicht gekocht, dennoch Läden gleich um die Ecke. Frühstück ebenfalls ums Eck möglich. Die Kommunikation mit Hendrike war bestens. Schnell und unkompliziert. Die Schlüsselübergabe hat wie besprochen geklappt. Hendrike hat uns gute Tipps gegeben, die wir zum Großteil befolgt haben. Hat sich gelohnt. Ich würde jederzeit wieder kommen. Danke"
74,151908100,5/14/2017,Christopher,Great location for first timers to Amsterdam... very clean 
74,527161574,9/10/2019,Barton,"Terrific Location near the city center. Check In was a breeze. We were greeted upon arrival and given a walk thru so we could be sure we knew how everything worked.  We spent our days walking to museums, shops, markets and galleries, and they were all an easy stroll from this well located apartment.  The home is clean and spacious with a large and luxurious living room sofa - plenty of space to lounge and read or watch a little TV. We made several meals at home in the well appointed and nicely laid out kitchen.  Beds were comfortable and we were even able to do a load of laundry while in town. A big thank you to Hendrike for sharing her lovely home with us."
74,529692326,9/15/2019,Martina,"Beautiful apartment in an unbeatable location! Hendrike was a wonderful host, going above and beyond to accommodate our family’s needs and make our stay as comfortable as possible."

74,547521548,10/15/2019,Jeffrey,"This is a lovely 2 bedroom apartment near the Central train station. Lots of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and clothing stores nearby. The second bed is a futon sofa that folds out. There is a door between the second bedroom and the rest of the space--but the main bedroom is essentially a loft above the kitchen and living area. Also, the stairway up to the main bedroom is steep and has small treads, even by Amsterdam standards. I was not able to get my suitcase up that stairway. The space itself is recently remodeled and lovely."
74,550743513,10/19/2019,Rick,Fantastic place and a great location. We really enjoyed our stay and Hendrike was a great host. Will definitely stay again.

74,586853156,1/2/2020,Simone,Excellent location for exploring Amsterdam! Hendricke and her partner were there to meet us on arrival and left us a bottle of bubbles. The apartment itself is lovely.
74,602025902,2/5/2020,A F,"The location is perfect. <br/><br/>Very close to the main spots. <br/><br/>Right next to the building you can find an italian restaurant with great pizza.<br/><br/>Easy to check in. <br/><br/>The place is great, clean, completely fitted, very comfortable."
74,605275025,2/14/2020,Emily,"This house is incredible! You would never guess this beautiful penthouse would be right in the centre of Amsterdam. Not only was it clean and stylish, but the welcome notes and proposed activities we were given was wonderful.<br/><br/>The master bedroom is absolutely stunning and worth hiring alone, but the second bedroom was comfortable for two to sleep if you need to fill with 4 people! <br/><br/>Thanks so much for your hospitality Hendrike, I would book again!"
74,626507696,5/28/2020,Maura,"Beautiful family apartment is a great section of Amsterdam! Hendrike is a lovely host and everything about the experience exceeded expectations, especially the roof terrace! The plants and decor indoors and outdoors are very stylish. The furniture and beds are comfy and I’d love to stay here again! Thank you Hendrike!"

98,29860981,4/13/2015,Arndis,"Arend tók vel og stundvíslega á móti okkur á umsömdum tíma. Hann lýsti íbúðinni vel og benti okkur á góða veitingastaði í nágrenninu. Íbúðin sjálf er frábærlega staðsett, stór og falleg í rómantískum stíl.<br/><br/>Stigar voru nokkuð þröngir og brattir og henta því illa fólki sem er bakveikt eða með mikinn farangur. <br/><br/>Aftur á móti voru rúm og sængur góð og eldhúsið vel búið.<br/><br/>Í heild dásamleg gisting."
98,30315901,4/20/2015,Mie,"We had a really good stay, and had pleanty of room in the house. We were four girls, and with almost a bathroom for each of us it was perfect :) <br/>Besides that the area was really nice and close to the center. "
98,30646201,4/25/2015,Jeremy,"Arend and Diana were very welcoming and helpful. There space is simply awesome. Three floors of very comfortable living space. The attention to detail in there place makes it a very comfy place to hang out.  The beds are comfy, kitchen very well equipped and the terrace is a delight when sunny! I would definitely come back. "
98,30976644,4/30/2015,Sybil,"From our viewing of photos online when we originally booked this apartment, we expected to have two bedrooms and two full baths on the second floor. Instead, the second bedroom on that floor had been converted to a clothing and storage room, and its adjoining bathroom was not fully functional...i.e., the shower and sink were not working, only the toilet was.<br/>There was a second bedroom on the attic (third) floor with twin beds and a bathroom with sink and shower (no toilet), but that level was only accessible by a steep, curved stairway with small steps and no bannister.<br/>We are three 74-year-old women (one with two knee replacements) and so that attic level was not appropriate for us, especially with no toilet and no bannister on the stairway.<br/>The owners, Diana and Arend, were very welcoming, even helping us up and down with our suitcases, and gracious and kind enough to move one of the twin beds from the attic level down to the main level for our use.<br/>This apartment, in all other ways, was beautiful, modern, clean and bright. We enjoyed having breakfast and espresso in the kitchen each morning and ending our evenings in the comfortable living room watching a little TV. <br/>We also loved the location on Haarlemerdijk which was just perfect with its many shops and small restaurants, which we frequented, its many bicyclists and light vehicle traffic. And it was a nice easy 15-minute walk to the Centraal station and to the city trams."
98,46093417,9/7/2015,Scott,"This apartment was beautiful and very clean. the living room provided a great comfortable place to relax and watch TV. There is a great patio outback when the sun is out. the second floor provides the master bedroom and 2 bathrooms. The third floor provided 2 twin beds and a shower.<br/>The location of this apartment is along a small downtown street with shops and plenty of food and market options. At night the street quiets down, so no worries on some loud party people outside keeping you up. What's also great about this location is that its less than 10 minute walk to the main downtown of Amsterdam, so it's really easy to go out and have a fun night without having to worry about driving or catching a cab.<br/>The hosts were very accommodating, and responded quickly over the messaging app. The next time I am in town, I hope to have the chance to stay at this listing again."
98,47262990,9/17/2015,Marco,"Bellissimo appartamento! Molto pulito e accessoriato, veramente confortevole.  A un passo dal centro. I proprietari sono stati veramente disponibili!<br/><br/>Lo consiglio a tutti."
98,47772340,9/21/2015,Cassander,"Great apartment in a fantastic location. <br/>Diana is a great host; super fast in responding and helpful. <br/>The check in process was smooth and a really nice touch with a Dutch welcome gift awaited. <br/>The apartment is spectacular - like in the pics but even better. <br/>The space is enormous with more bathrooms than you can shake a stick at. All mod cons are present. As with all typical Amsterdam buildings; space is at a premium and hence stairs are steep; bring comfy shoes! <br/>The street the apartment is on is genuinely great; everything you could ever need is on your doorstep and it is located very close to the central station. Make sure you book this apartment when next in Amsterdam; you won't regret it!! "
98,49021847,9/30/2015,Vicky,"We didn't meet the hosts but their friend Sorin,  who was charming and extremely helpful, the accommodation was fabulous, it was clean and spacious and had everything we needed in it. we also got a lovely welcome gift of coffee and prosecco.<br/><br/>the apartment is centrally located and you can get to all areas in Amsterdam easily from there, there are lovely bars and restaurants on the street and a good supermarket with everything we needed.<br/><br/>I will definitely recommend this house to my friends. <br/>was lovely thanks so much"
98,143325170,4/11/2017,Ali,Great place... Great host and great location
98,144550801,4/16/2017,Umesh,Great location 
98,146517482,4/23/2017,Peter,This apartment is huge!  A wonderful master bedroom for us and a very cool attic bedroom for the kids. Excellent main floor living and dining area with a great view of the streetscape below. Great back deck too!  Guests have to keep in mind that this is a three story unit that starts on the second floor but as long as you're able to climb a few simple flights of stairs you'll be fine. <br/><br/>The location is great with many basic but very good restaurants and grocery and specialty shops right on the block. A few blocks to the heart of the Jordaan. <br/><br/>Wonderful hosts and a great apartment. Definitely hope to return!<br/><br/>
98,255362156,4/20/2018,Polly,"Great location, clean cute place."

98,320050811,9/8/2018,Ewan,The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
98,327040482,9/23/2018,Louie,Awesome apartment in a great area. Arend and Diana were very flexible. Would recommend.
98,452448714,5/13/2019,Jake,"Good AirBnB listing but communication could have been much improved. We did not meet hosts Arend & Diana and checkin was done through friend Sorin. Upon checkin, we were given a brief overview and tour of the house — after checking out, we were later informed by the host they were unable to open the front door of the apartment and a locksmith needed to be called. Host submitted a claim with AirBnB with request to pay for the locksmith which was ultimately denied. Attempted to further communicate and resolve, but did not receive any further response from host. We did not feel the host was very accommodating to this unfortunate circumstance."
98,455036565,5/19/2019,Emer,This is a lovely apartment in a great location. A friend of Arend and Diana’s checked us in as they were on vacation. He was very helpful with local knowledge etc.<br/>The apartment is beautifully designed and very comfortable. The roof terrace was a bonus.
98,456752031,5/22/2019,Jenni,The common space is amazing- especially the living room and patio. Arend and Diana were great and super easy to communicate with. We had a few small issues -the second bedroom is essentially an attic - so I wouldn’t recommend having adults stay upstairs. The upstairs shower/bathroom doesn’t have great ventilation so it smells a bit like mold if you don’t keep the fan on for extended periods of time. Other than that- the space is great and large and was perfect for what we needed. Great location!
98,529713700,9/15/2019,Joshua,"Firstly, Amsterdam is simply one of the best citys in Europe, which has a mix of absolute everything you could want from a few days away. And Arend and Diana's place is just such an amazing spot to enjoy the spoils of the city whilst having a home from home to unwind and relax. <br/><br/>Location was absolutely perfect. In Jordaan which is such a chilled area, with so many awesome little bars, restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques, cafes, etc. And still so near to the very centre of town.<br/><br/>Apartment was even better than expected, in fact, I dont think the pics do it justice. The whole living area is just such a great space to relax after a full day out. Roof terrace an absolute treat for morning coffee, afternoon drinks. Couldn't have asked for any more amenities, literally every single thing covered, and our hosts also kindly left us some wine, beers, nespresso pods and other bits we could make use of. <br/><br/>Bedrooms and bathrooms as you should expect, comfy and clean.<br/><br/>Neighbourhood friend Sorin sorted check in and out swiftly and conveniently.<br/><br/>Comms was great throughout, and great local tips which were a good help! <br/><br/>All in fab stay, highly recommend and look forward to my next trip out!"
98,531362189,9/17/2019,Nicole,Great stay
98,538022109,9/29/2019,Sasa,"Superbe appartment, excellent central area, spacious and with all amenities need for a great stay. We would definitively come back and recommend the place without hesitation!"
49,40205888,7/29/2015,Julia,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful. There were 5 of us and we couldn't have been more comfortable. Ellen's place is so beautiful and the pictures really don't do it enough justice. There was more than enough space for all of us and we were beyond happy with our stay. The neighbourhood was   very ideal - just outside the centre, with such delicious restaurants to visit. Would definitely visit again and couldn't recommend it more! "
49,41331864,8/7/2015,Marin,"Really pleasant journey in this lovely flat<br/>Borough is really calm as the neighbor , and we really enjoyed to watch at the sunset every day <br/>"
49,42538410,8/14/2015,Adrien,"We really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam. The appartment is amazing: wide and well arranged... <br/>We really liked the rooftop terrace where you can enjoy beautiful sunsets, and the huge bathtub in the master bedroom.<br/>On the other hand, the appartment is at least half an hour far from the outer rim of Amsterdam center by foot, but moving with bicycles solves this problem."
49,51947064,10/25/2015,Grace,"We had a fantastic time at Ellen's apartment. It was extremely spacious and had everything we needed. Even nicer than it looks in the pictures! Ellen communicated everything we needed beforehand.<br/><br/>We really liked the area and could either walk into town or hire bikes from the shop at the end of the street at only 9 Euros per day. The areas you go through to reach the city centre are interesting with lots of good shops and restaurants - don't just get the tram in as you will miss these!<br/><br/>"
49,92758041,8/10/2016,Lana,"The host has checked with me with a good period of time for us to be prepared, and checked so that we could get the key even if we got lost on our way from the airport. The house is amazing, it feels that the owners have own relaxed and classy taste. 6 people can be hosted there easily and everybody can get own room. The bedroom on the 4th floor made us feel we stay in a castle. The big terrass on the roof is wonderful, too! The owner's cat Sophie is cute, too, very sociable and easy, and she is used to the guests. <br/>The area is amazing, so many nice restaurants, shops, good communications and still, it is not a busy tourist centre. We could really enjoy the breath of real Amsterdam, thank you Ellen!<br/>"
49,94280358,8/15/2016,Claudine,Ellen hat professionell den Kontakt geführt und war überaus angenehm und hilfreich! Sie hat Unterlagen mit Tipps und Ratschlägen zusammengestellt und sich als hervorragende Gastgeberin erwiesen! Es gibt in kleinster Weide absolut irgendetwas zu beanstanden! Uneingeschränkte Empfehlung!
49,134153213,2/26/2017,רוני,Ellen's place is beautiful! <br/>very close to the center.<br/>hosted us lovely
49,179263604,8/7/2017,Andrew,"Ellen was very communicative prior to our arrival and made the check in process easy through her neighbor.  She left very particular instructions for each the rooms of her home as well as caring for her cat Sophie.  Sophie was easy to care for her though she did get sick on one occasion.  Everything we needed (grocery, some restaurants) were within a few steps walking distance from her apartment, and with public transportation it was very easy to get around all of the city during our week stay."
49,182753242,8/15/2017,Charlotte,"We had an amazing time at Ellen's place! The apartment is beautiful with more than enough space for all 4 of us. We particularly loved the terrace, which offers a beautiful view over the city and is perfectly set up for spending time relaxing with friends after a busy day of exploring Amsterdam. We also loved taking care of Sophie the cat, she's a sweetheart and was a pleasure to live with!<br/>The location is fab, close to supermarkets/street markets for supplies and bars and restaurants too. The transport links were great too, with plenty of bus and tram stops nearby the apartment. <br/>Ellen herself was so kind to us, an attentive host who answered all our questions about about the flat and the city itself. Couldn't recommend enough, 5/5 stars!"
49,188008878,8/28/2017,Dustin,"Centrally located beautiful family home just outside of the hustle and bustle of Centrum. Quiet neighborhood with everything you could ever need 2 minute walk away. Pizza shops, grocery store, and excellent pubs all less than a block away really made this place a one-stop shop.  <br/><br/>House was beautiful, clean and exactly like the pictures. The cat Sophie is a total sweetheart; very affectionate and friendly. Rooftop patio gave a great view of the neighborhood and was perfect for a couple beers under the night sky before catching a short ride to downtown on the 13, 14, or 7 trams.<br/><br/>Ellen was extremely helpful in getting us settled in and providing ideas for fun stuff to do in town! If you're looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam I would highly recommend staying here!"

49,303378254,8/7/2018,Richard,The flat was as good as we had expected. The terrace is lovely - a great place to chill in the evening. The area is nice and quiet and inhabited mostly by locals
49,306206705,8/12/2018,Valerio,"Very nice apartment, good location, well connected and at walking distance from the centre. You need to like feline because the old lovely cat Sophie is going to share the flat with you."
93,33866539,6/1/2015,Jim,"Karl's apartment is in a wonderful part of Amsterdam I had never been to before. The apartment is beautifully furnished, bright and open, has a ton of character, and a kitchen that begs to be used. Communication was a snap, I was met with win, snacks, fruit, and a great list of how the different things in the apartment work as well as local places to try. I loved that the recommendations didn't just list a name and address but also a reason to try it."
93,39133055,7/20/2015,Melvyn,"The apartment was perfect. And the rooftop is so great.<br/>The neighborhood is really good, everything is near.<br/>Thanks Karel"

93,42612497,8/14/2015,Mathieu,"The house was perfect, and the houskeepers answered very quickly to our questions. The district is closed to the center and still quiet. I would strongly recommand this flat to a friend. "
93,43679117,8/21/2015,Ute,"The first contact was nearly immediately (prompt response to our enquiry) and open questions before travelling were answered quickly.<br/>On our arrival Casper awaited us at the apartment for last instructions.<br/>The apartment is comfortable and cosy, lies in a quiet living-area with all you need nearby ( supermarket, bike-rental, bus and tramstop) and the pictures are authentic.<br/>We nearly felt at home during our 5-day-trip to Amsterdam."
93,44496307,8/26/2015,Jordan,"I want to come back to Amsterdam just to stay in this lovely home! What a magical place... In a peaceful neighborhood, close walk to the centre, also bordering Westerpark which is just great... The home itself is on the top floor, with beautiful light coming in, lots of space, everything you need. This is one of those places that feels like a real home -- so cozy. There is a balcony *and* a terrace which is Fantastic. Nothing but good things to say. Karel's friend Casper saw me in and was very communicative and easy going. Rent this place... this is what airbnb is all about ~ A+"
93,62223478,2/12/2016,Alexandre,"Thanks a lot to you, Karel. Everything was great. The place was clean and 15 min away from the center. Perfect.<br/>Would definitely recommend this apartment."
93,90956089,8/3/2016,Lena,"The apartment itself was very nice, it just wasn't clean. The fridge was dirty, the dishes had not been done properly and the oven was full of crumbs.<br/><br/>The area around the apartment is great and we had some great fries as suggested in the ""manual"" from the apartment owners. You can walk to the city easily or take the tram - and the roof terrace is great. <br/><br/>"
93,91609227,8/6/2016,Jonathan,An amazing apartment in a great location. The roof terrace was superb for relaxing on. I would def recommend this to other people. Karel was very responsive and a great host. Very satisfied!!!
93,108922067,10/18/2016,Joe,"Very cozy space in a great neighborhood in Amsterdam. It is nearby lots of great restaurants, bars, and Westerpark which are less busy and touristy than city center. Still only 15-20 minutes walk from the center. "

97,50241822,10/10/2015,Kylie,"Wonderful room with an amazing view. We were greeted warmly by Marina who showed us around the apartment. The kitchen is BURSTING with food! It was great being able to have some breakfast there every morning.<br/><br/>The room itself was nice and the bed comfy. We had an outdoor terrace off our room which would have been nice to use if the weather was better.<br/><br/>There is one shared bathroom for all the rooms (I think there are 4 rooms?), the toilet is separate which is good. The shared bathroom wasn't ever an issue. <br/><br/>We liked the location, lots of places to eat within a short walk. It was also good to have the free bikes to explore more of Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Giovanni was friendly and helped us print out some museum tickets.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend staying here, only wish we'd had more time!"
97,50904269,10/15/2015,Celia,"Très agréable, nous avons été très bien accueilli. Javier nous a tout bien  expliqué et mis à l'aise dans l'appartement qui est exactement comme sur la photo.Très propre et la vue est incroyable. On reviendra en été pour profiter de la terrasse privée."

97,63669562,2/25/2016,Christi,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Giovanni's place.  Unfortunately I was ill throughout my visit, but I found the apt to be the perfect some to spend all my time, and didn't feel confined at all because the views were spectacular and felt like I was outdoors at all times.  Javier was an excellent liaison -very friendly and helpful. Giovanni also helped me to to it an urgent business document as I couldn't go out to search for a place to do so.<br/>I would totally recommend a stay at Giovanni's place."
97,65180935,3/11/2016,Yuri,"Giovanni and Javier were very laid back and easy to coordinate with.  The apartment has an amazing view and natural lighting.  Plenty of privacy in the room.  <br/>Fully equipped kitchen is also a major bonus."
97,68818521,4/6/2016,Adam,"Very nice private room with balcony in shared apartment space. View from 14th floor over Amsterdam is really unique. Location is west of city centre, but public transport is easily accessible and a bike is provided. Having a kitchen stocked with food and a phone with internet are really great features!"
97,77912002,6/4/2016,Arik,"Stayed for a week, in the end of May 2016, and this was my first Airbnb experience - and it was a BOMB!<br/><br/>The location - a 10 mins bike to from the centerum, (the bike comes with the room). The Apartment is SUPER clean, The bathroom and restroom are being polished an a daily bases. The place is full with all the regular appliances: washing machine + dryer, coffee machine, dishwasher, etc.<br/><br/>The kitchen is PACKED with food, the cupboards and fridge are being constantly re-filled with quite nice products, and you can see the special attention for healthy foods, vegetables and fruits.<br/><br/>The hosts - Javier is soooo nice and welcoming, he is very pleasant and extra polite - a true gentleman, who has hands on everything. Giovanni (the owner) is an intelligent individual, we had some nice conversations, he is cool guy and very helpful. Great hosts.<br/><br/>Last thing - other then the seagulls that fly in this altitude - The VIEW is totally amazing!  + there is a nice balcony to enjoy the view even more.<br/><br/>I will surely recommend ""the locals"" to my best friends, and will totally return there on my next visit."
97,79308105,6/12/2016,Priscilla,Amazing view and experience stayed in Giovanni's house . The penthouse apartment is beautiful with comfort decorations . They provide a iPhone to use as wifi hotspot and Free bike I was really grateful for those . They having a kitchen with food and drink . The host also provided very details direction on how to find apartment before check in . I would totally recommend stay at this place in Ams 
97,89552167,7/29/2016,Isabella,"My husband and I stayed at this lovely place in Amsterdam for two nights, it is only 15 min walk to the center of 5 min riding a bike. The place was clean and Diego was very nice and helpful. I only wish we didn't had to share the bathroom with so many people (other guest renting the 3 other rooms), besides that, we highly recommend this place."
97,90121546,7/31/2016,Ann,"We had an incredible time in Amsterdam and our room was beautiful. We arrived later than expected due to a flight delay and they we're so accommodating. The bikes were the perfect addition to the Amsterdam experience and allowed us to feel like locals for a few days. The view was incredible and so we're all the the extra special touched. Diego welcomed us and was available throughout our stay to answer any questions. Love, love, love the experience. "
97,97410096,8/27/2016,Daniel,"Simply amazing. The view is gorgeous, Diego is very responsive and always willing to help, and the place was kept clean. The free food is a bonus too! <br/><br/>I highly recommend staying here if you're in Amsterdam for any reason. Cheaper and better than getting a fancy hotel..."
97,100224347,9/8/2016,Alice,"Nous avons passé 2 nuits dans ce superbe appartement et tout était parfait! Giovanni nous a donné toutes les informations dont nous avions besoin avant notre arrivée et Javier a été très accueillant. La chambre était très agréable avec une vue spectaculaire sur Amsterdam.

97,107571806,10/11/2016,Konrad,"Great place to stay, super friendly staff, perfect supply with WLAN also on the go (via an old phone and WLAN thetering).  A bit off the center but if you're good on the bike you're in the center in 15 min."

97,121120258,12/14/2016,Kirsi,"Giovanni and Javier gave me very accurate information. All the messages were super polite and they replied really fast. Absolutely amazing breakfast and a big plus for the mobile hot spot that you can use while staying there. I loved that I could use the bike. <br/><br/>The apartment is very close to EVERYTHING, with bike or with bus/tram you can reach any destination within some minutes. Very peaceful location.<br/> "
97,121830730,12/19/2016,Natalie & Dimitri,"I had a great stay here. Everything was thought of to include the use of bikes (a must do while in Amsterdam). They had purchased a bunch of food so as to make you feel as comfortable and welcomed as possible. I loved having a morning coffee while sitting on the balcony! The location is great for the price, you can take a tram to get into city center or a quick 10 minute bike ride. I would definitely stay here again and will whenever I'm in Amsterdam!<br/>"
97,123016411,12/27/2016,Sam,Better than imagination.
97,124097106,1/1/2017,Tarek,"This is the place to be to discover Amsterdam, loads of options (comfy bed, internet everywhere, bike at your disposal, and plenty of food and drink) I loved the experience...this is a proper listing "

97,132786318,2/19/2017,Josue,The kitchen was full of food always and the barrowed bikes was perfect if you like to ride. For 1 room with shared bathroom is overpriced for me.

97,155847692,5/29/2017,Yulia,"Loved that bikes were available, loved the views, room was cute, neighborhood was residential but walking distance to center of town. Be aware that the bathroom is shared by a lot of people and if the place is full, it can get noisy."

Also, Casper the cat is the nicest. Additionally, Demian and Eunice left us some great tips concerning their neighborhood, which was a perfect way to discover another side of the city. <br/>I would recommend it to any friend who comes for a visit in Amsterdam and we would definitely come back in the flat if we have the chance. "
76,43090170,8/17/2015,Amaury,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour  chez Demian et Eunice (et Casper) l'appartement est grand, propre, confortable et très calme. Le chat Casper est adorable et très convivial. L'endroit n'est pas vraiment dans le centre ville mais les deux vélos à disposition vous emmènent dans le centre en 10 minutes à peine par des chemins très agréables. Nous avons eu la chance de croiser nos hôtes qui étaient très chaleureux et nous ont offert des pommes du jardins. Je recommande vivement cet endroit. "
76,45271733,9/1/2015,Mirco,"Great place to stay in Amsterdam. The flat has everything you need and its position is really convenient. It is in a nice neighbourhood really close to shops and bars.<br/>We loved it! <br/>And having 2 bikes for free is a big plus."

76,64810361,3/8/2016,Otis,"We had a great time staying here! The flat was was exactly as in the pictures and the kitchen was very well kitted out. The street the flat is on is quiet and the nearby main street is like a village in itself; it has all essentials like shops, bars, cafés, etc. The bikes were handy (one had a puncture when we arrived but Eunice refunded the repair). One day it was raining and we didn't fancy cycling so we took public transport which was just as easy, trams to city centre were just a 2 minute walk."
76,65541481,3/15/2016,Essi,"The house was wonderful and very cozy. The wood floors and mix mached furniture were beautiful and the bedroom was a serene white.

73,46210944,9/8/2015,Christina,"The neighborhood, the location, and the apartment were amazing! Location is probably the best part of this place. Walking distance to the heart of the city, and plenty of food/coffeeshops/and other things to do in the immediate area. Made for a perfect weekend trip in beautiful Amsterdam. "
73,47056194,9/15/2015,Conor,"The apartment provided the perfect base for both attending a conference at the RAI and spending time in the city. Fantastic location, minutes away from the Albert Cuyp market, the Heineken Experience and a whole host of lovely shops and restaurants.

73,48026901,9/22/2015,Eric,"This is a really lovely flat in an ideal area of Amsterdam. The check-in was extremely easy, and Marigai (Jennifer's friend) made us very welcome. The flat is beautiful, really well kept with everything you need, full of character, light and cheerful. It is really easy to get from the flat to the museum district which is walking distance, and you are surrounded by nice bars and great places to eat. We got 48 hour bus tickets which made travelling around simple: the flat is on a good route. Ideal: we'd definitely come back to see more of Amsterdam and stay in this friendly and tasteful flat. "
73,48569839,9/27/2015,Li,"We stayed here for just two days,but we love this cozy and warm apartment very much.It only took you 30min walk to the Dam Square and the view along the street is so natural and beautiful!We strongly recommend this nice apartment to you!You will enjoy the stay in Amsterdam better through this decision.:))"

73,50796432,10/14/2015,Matthew,"The perfect apartment, we couldn't have been happier. The apartment made you want to stay indoors! Tastefully done, clean and comfortable, you feel at home. <br/><br/>The suburb is probably best if you are like us, interested in good food, trendy bars and fashion/design. Jen supplied a great map with their favorite places and we used it extensively, not one disappointment. <br/><br/>Check in was easy. Not one complaint. "
73,51166272,10/18/2015,Eric,"I can't describe how pleasing it was to walk into such a stylish and homely apartment (after having scaled such a challenging staircase with our luggage!). It's typical Amsterdam and it's truly awesome!  Great neighbourhood vibe, close to main market and the museums! Transport on trams right on the doorstep made it easy to get around.  "
73,51633890,10/22/2015,Kenneth,A condo with lots of character. Really felt like a local staying here in the heart of the de pijp neighborhood. Easy access to sights and great restaurants. Would love to stay here again.
73,52864710,11/2/2015,Noor,"The host made me feel very comfortable and followed up with me throughout my stay to make sure I was okay.  Marigai helped me organize airport transport and help with my luggage as I had quite a bit.  The apartment was exactly as was presented online, very comfortable and cosy.  The area is very close to restaurants, museums, supermarkets and the center.  Excellent stay, very much recommended."
73,58136623,1/1/2016,Katherine,"We had a great stay at Jennifer's apartment. It's really bright, comfortable and stylish - just like the photos. It's brilliantly situated in a vibrant neighbourhood with great shops, cafes and restaurants. It's close to public transport and central enough to walk to most places.

I highly recommend this place and this host. <br/>FR : Un appartement parfaitement décoré et très agréable à vivre.

28,50199781,10/10/2015,Alexander,"A friend and I stayed on the Jupiter for 4 nights and loved the layout of the boat and location. Clean on arrival and with the hosts on the end of a line it was reassuring that if a problem arised (which it didn't) there was contact with someone, I would highly recommend a stay on the Jupiter and if your lucky you will see the skinny bridge open for larger boats. All in all a fantastic stay :-)"
28,52121300,10/26/2015,João,"Very comfortable houseboat, beautiful decoration inside, recently reformed so everything looks new and shiny, space is good enough for 2 couples, the heating system works perfectly, everything was nicely clean. We were a little worked about security at first, but we ended up feel in very safe and secure inside it. Very quiet at nigh, we also slept very well every night spent. Just beware it is not kid or elderly friendly as you have to walk through another boat to reach this one, and this can be dangerous to do with a kid on your lap or to somebody with disabillites. Inside the boat, there are 2 stairs and some ""holes"" communicating first to second floor, which is very nice for decoration but poses a risk for the kids (we had to put our luggage and find some way to block our daughter from reaching and falling). Richard is a very friendly guy and willing to help with our needs. Overall the ""Jupiter"" boathouse was a fantastic experience, and just 10-15min walk to the city center. Definitely recommend to anybody without little children or elderly with some sort of impairment. "
28,56828079,12/18/2015,Julian,"We had a great few days on Richard's boat, a perfect location and very comfortable. Richard was very helpful in setting up our visit at rather short notice and very good company when he visited! "
28,57765559,12/29/2015,Paul,"This houseboat was the highlight of our trip! It was an amazing stay for our first Airbnb and Richard was very accommodating with all and any of our needs. If you are looking for a true Amsterdam experience look no further, you will not regret spending time on this modern houseboat and soaking in the local sights from multiple portholes. Thank you Richard for an unforgettable experience."
28,61209554,2/1/2016,Jean Dominique,"Un logement bien décrit; j'aurais souhaité que soit mentionné le fait qu'une partie du houseboat était occupée par le propriétaire, au demeurant fort sympathique.<br/>L'accueil parfait."

28,66161267,3/20/2016,Roberto,What a wonderfull choice!! Per noi è stata la prima volta con airbnb e siamo stati molto contenti. E' un esperienza che consiglio e la barca/casa Jupiter è veramente bella e situata bene in città. A 5/10 minuti da tutto. Richard è stato molto ospitale e gentile.
28,67771109,3/31/2016,Vincenzo,"Great experience, boat top!"
28,69444676,4/11/2016,Lars,"En fantastisk husbåt som ga oss en skikkelig WOW opplevelse. Kåret til den flotteste husbåten i 2015, og det kan vi skrive under på. <br/>Eieren var i møtekommen til våre behov og hadde til og med mulighet til å møte oss når vi ankom veldig sent til innsjekk. <br/><br/>Husbåten var moderne og lå midt i ""smørøyet"" til alt. Men likevel var man litt tilbaketrukket. <br/><br/> Var fantastisk å sitte på dekk å se på båtene og folk bare suse forbi i sola. "
28,77687669,6/2/2016,Paris,"Houseboat Jupiter was great way to stay in Amsterdam. The location is perfect for walking around to all the top areas and easy to get to via train. The space itself is just as described and equipped with all the essentials. Only regret was not getting to hang out on the boat more than we did! <br/>We had a bit of miscommunication regarding check in that could have been avoided as they had workers working on the boat during what we anticipated as our time to freshen up and hang out there.  But, overall the stay was nice and hosts were responsive to our needs. "
28,78904690,6/10/2016,Michael,"The view is worth its weight in gold. So fun to live in the canal and have all of Amsterdam come to you. The beds were great and the kitchen was perfect for making food.<br/>"
28,83256871,7/2/2016,Clay,"Really excellent experience. Richard is a great host; friendly and helpful. The houseboat is beautiful and in a fantastic location. I thought it might be a bit noisy, but since the Magere Brug is a pedestrian bridge, there wasn't much street noise at all. Highly recommended!"
28,84928637,7/9/2016,Simon,"Lovely boat in a perfect location next to the 'skinny bridge'. Richard made us feel very welcome and was very friendly and helpful.

28,98578781,8/31/2016,Eva,"We had a very nice stay at Richard's and Birgit's houseboat. It's really next to all points you want to reach in the city, directly at the Skinny Bridge and everything in walking distance. <br/>The family is adorable, kind and very nice. Also the houseboat itself is beautiful! Perfect to live there for your stay, I wouldn't choose anything else for Amsterdam! "
28,106960130,10/8/2016,Janet,"Houseboat Jupiter was in a fantastic location, walking distance to most everything. The pictures were spot on ~ the beds were comfortable, linens nice, very spacious for two couples. Didn't realize that the owners lived on second half of the same boat. Richard and Brigit were very accommodating with us arriving early. I highly recommend stating here! "
28,110416562,10/26/2016,Sarah,Richard was very helpful. He showed us how everything worked and was easily available if we had any questions.
28,113538247,11/13/2016,Jean-Philippe,"Highly recommended. <br/>We stayed 3 nights with a couple of friends on the houseboat. Very well located in the city center, close to many activity and cultural areas and  very quiet at night. <br/><br/>The houseboat is luxurious and very comfortable and remarkably well equipped. Nothing is missing. (Wifi, Nespresso coffee maker "
28,127146683,1/16/2017,Rahssan,"Great accommodations and great location! I was concerned about staying on a houseboat in the winter, but it was very warm and comfortable! Walking distance to Rembrandt Square! Highly recommend!"

28,155031343,5/27/2017,Sabrina,Es war eine wirklich tolle Erfahrung auf dem Hausboot. Es ist sehr gut ausgestattet und hat eine TOP Lage. Wir hatten zu viert 3 wunderschöne Tage. Es war traumhaft. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen und immer wieder auf einem Hausboot in Amsterdam wohnen. :) Danke.
28,156607512,5/31/2017,Kelly,We absolutely loved our stay on the houseboat. It was a perfect location close to everything but not in the middle of the crazy tourist area.  
28,164979715,6/30/2017,Emily,"Perfect in every way.  Beautiful boat, wonderful location, very clean, excellent amenities - jacuzzi, nespresso machine, hairdryer.  Probably not suitable for very young children because of holes in the floor and the difficulty of carrying a child/baby into the boat."
28,167297503,7/6/2017,Jane,"We enjoyed our stay on Houseboat Jupiter.   The location was great, and it was fun being on the boat.<br/><br/>Had a good evening in with takeaway pizza from the place a couple of doors up the street across the road, but also ate at nearby restaurants<br/><br/>Highly recommend renting bikes for the duration of your stay (got ours from Black Bikes)  "
28,180464912,8/10/2017,Chad,Staying on this boat was amazing. We loved the  location for it's convenience and decent amount of activity on the waterway. Great fun sitting on the deck on a bean bag watching the boats go by whilst having a few beers. The people of Amsterdam are amazing and I have never visited a place where everyone is so friendly and helpful. Wished we stayed there longer.
28,183877983,8/18/2017,Bernd,Das Hausboot ist eine wunderbare Unterkunft in toller Lage. Ausreichend Platz für 4 Personen. Trotz der zentralen Lage ist es Nachts angenehm ruhig. Richard und Birgit haben tolle Informationen bereits gestellt und waren auch bzgl. Check-In sehr flexibel.
28,195959695,9/21/2017,Jeff,"Jupiter was a fantastic sanctuary in the middle of busy Amsterdam. Easy walking distance to the museums, central train station, and right in the midst of downtown, yet very quiet in the evening. We slept peacefully and late most mornings it was so quiet! The houseboat is well equipped and comfortable!"
28,196678629,9/24/2017,Mikaela,"Båten motsvarade beskrivningen. Vi var väldigt nöjda med vår vistelse, hur skönt som helst att sitta på taket i en fatboy i eftermiddagssolen. Bra avstånd till god mat, och uber finns alltid nära när man vill lite längre. Mycket bra boende!"
28,198069806,9/28/2017,Joao Carlos,"What an experience! To have the sunset on a boat, located close to the skinny bridge, an excelent bar and tons of market options. And, it’s a boat in Amsterdam!"
28,201397009,10/8/2017,Karin,"Die Lage des Hausbootes ist einfach genial. Direkt angrenzend zum Zentrum und doch so leise. Das Boot ist total cool und stylisch, aber auch sehr gemütlich. Sehr sauber. Ganz einfach zum Empfehlen. Richard ist ein toller Gastgeber und sehr bemüht deine Anliegen zu erfüllen. Wir 4 Mädels (alle über 50) können diese Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen. Es ist etwas ganz Besonderes in dieser Art in Amsterdam zu übernachten. Karin,Sabine,Gabi und Christine aus Österreich nahe Linz."
28,205103526,10/21/2017,Randall,"Fun and unique way to stay in Amsterdam.  Richard’s houseboat was amazing, it is fun to just look out the window at the boats that cruise by, and the swans and ducks that like to visit while your there.  There is a nice restaurant just across the street with some great food, and a nice patio to have a drink.  Richard was very informative and helpful during our stay.  It is also within 2 blocks of a tram stop which will take you to city center.  Highly recommend Richard’s houseboat if you want something different from a hotel."
28,206634706,10/26/2017,Terry,"Fantastic experience all round. The boat is beautiful, modern, clean, spacious and very comfortable. The location is excellent. Easy walk to trains and to many different excellent quality restaurants and bars. We couldn't have been happier and will certainly be back. Thanks so much."
28,208413855,11/1/2017,Medea,Expérience exceptionnelle que de séjourner sur une péniche en plein centre d'une capitale européenne!
28,209403910,11/5/2017,Louisa,Houseboat Jupiter was a fantastic place to stay and explore the beauty of Amsterdam.  The accommodation was extremely comfortable and really warm (considering it was pretty cold November weekend).  We loved the views from our portholes - being at water-level meant we could really appreciate all the activity on the water !  The closeness to fabulous shopping and restaurants was an added bonus.  The only thing we didn't do was hire bikes but this was only because we were happy to explore on foot.  The houseboat was immaculate and Richard came and welcomed us despite have dreadful flu.  We felt really well looked after and loved returning to the boat each night after a full day on our feet!  We definitely hope to return again soon!
28,213443062,11/21/2017,Denise,"After some initial trouble entering the boat because of key box problems (made worse unfortunately by a cold rain and the fact we had landed many, many hours earlier), we had a fantastic time staying here.  In addition to the simple novelty of staying on a boat on a river in one of the best parts of town, we just happened to be there the weekend that Sinter Klaus arrives with his flotilla, so we had a front row seat (with coffee and heat steps away) to watch this annual holiday event.  At night we had a visiting swan tap insistently (?) on our windows and could watch the lights play across the river while sitting at the table.  This also must be an incredible ""apartment"" in the summer.  One note on the access to the boat, you have to be agile enough to step across two fairly wide chasms to get onto the boat, and neither of the staircases on the boat have any handrails or ropes.  My 80 year old mother was fine(ish) (at night in the rainy dark we were a little nervous), but this would definitely not work for someone who had mobility issues or was very young.  This was our first Airbnb ever and convinced us the error of our hoteling ways."
28,218150226,12/11/2017,Antonio,"Great experience, Jupier is a lovely boat, the houseboat is very quiet and the location is excellent, thanks Marijke and Richard"
28,224500656,1/3/2018,Sandra,Unfassbare Lage - direkt am Zentrum der Stadt - alles zu Fuß erlebbar! Das Boot ist toll eingerichtet - wohlfühlen von der ersten Sekunde. <br/>Hat alles traumhaft funktioniert - können wir also wärmstens weiterempfehlen.
28,237256803,2/22/2018,Piolo Jose,It was a great experience altogether... Richard was readily available and marijke was really helpful with our concerns...
28,250821725,4/6/2018,Susanne,"Super tolle Wohnung, wir fühlten uns sehr wohl. Ein unvergessliches Erlebnis auf der Amstel,  auf einem so geschmackvollen Schiff zu wohnen. Lage zentral und dennoch sehr ruhig. Küche gut eingerichtet,  es hat alles was es braucht um einfache Gerichte zu kochen. Die Betten sind Super bequem! Sehr empfehlenswerte Wohnung mit sympathischem Gastgeber. Gerne wieder."
28,252036496,4/9/2018,Elizabeth,"Wow, wow, wow, That was the response we received from our two teenage boys as we arrived for a surprise stay on the Jupiter.  They had been expecting and apartment so when they saw the houseboat they were blown away. We were equally pleased as we entered at the commencement of our three day stay. And it was all we had hoped for. The Jupiter was spacious, well equipped, well resourced and in a beautiful location. As I stood in the living space for the first time I had views to the left, right and above - all unique and a beautiful representation of Amsterdam. We had not been to Amsterdam before so we were not certain which area to base ourselves from. Truly, it was the perfect location. Beautifully picturesque, and within walking distance from everything. The houseboat was warm, the beds were superbly comfortable, the bathroom ample size. The nights were quiet. Truly we loved our stay very much. We would highly recommend spending time in safe, young, proud and beautiful Amsterdam and equally so on the Jupiter."
28,258354459,4/29/2018,Keld Nymann,Nice place to stay in the center
28,260024414,5/3/2018,Christian,Tolles Hausboot in toller Lage!! Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind fussläufig gut erreichbar...
28,262821017,5/10/2018,Molly,"I travelled to Amsterdam with my two aunts in their fifties, and my cousin who is a 20-something like myself. We arrived by train very late at night and had a little bit of a hard time figuring out the door, as it is more of a hatch than a door. We had a lot of luggage as my cousin had just finished a 6 month study abroad semester, so it was quite interesting carrying it over two boats. I would recommend packing light! <br/><br/>The houseboat is immaculately clean and the beds were so comfortable after long days of sight-seeing. We enjoyed sitting on top of the boat and watching the action on the canal and enjoying people watching on the skinny bridge. Great value and awesome location. We decided to uber from Amsterdam Centraal because we had a lot of luggage, but it is walkable if you pack light. <br/><br/>Overall it was quiet, but there is a pub close by that was quite noisy as people were enjoying the gorgeous weather we had late into the night. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this houseboat to anyone looking for a unique and comfortable stay in Amsterdam!"
28,271720335,6/2/2018,Wolfgang,"Eine echt coole Unterkunft wo alles gepasst hat, noch dazu in optimaler Lage."
28,276012034,6/12/2018,Benjamin,Flawless. Excellent. Cannot wait to return. 
28,278054842,6/17/2018,Jean-Pascal,"Péniche magnifique, cadre superbe, un régal !"
28,279020857,6/19/2018,Chris,Beautiful boat. Much more spacious than we thought. Great location. Definitely a highlight of our stay in Amsterdam.
28,279959832,6/22/2018,Sherry,Beautiful houseboat in an excellent location! 
28,284044117,7/1/2018,Dennis,Great location
28,285958441,7/5/2018,Jeff,Great place and I'd recommend it to friends and family.
28,286445114,7/6/2018,Reuben,Highly recommended. Central and comfortable accommodation!  We will certainly return.
28,293403261,7/20/2018,Peter&Carola,"Die Lage des Hausboots direkt an der Skinny Bridge ist bombastisch. Morgens blickt man bei der Frühstückszubereitung durch die Fenster auf die erwachende Betriebsamkeit auf der Amstel und abends liegt man zu zweit auf dem grossen Liegekissen an Deck, geniesst bei einem Apéro die Wärme der untergehenden Sonne und betrachtet dabei das Schauspiel des Bootverkehrs - herrlich.<br/><br/>Im Spar gleich um die Ecke kann man sich an jedem Wochentag mit frischen Lebensmitteln eindecken. ÖV ist ebenfalls in wenigen Gehminuten erreichbar. Am besten und schnellsten ist man in Amsterdam für Sightseeing aber auch als Tourist mit dem Fahrrad unterwegs, welches man einfach in Bootsnähe ankettet.<br/><br/>Wir waren zu viert während einer Woche auf dem Hausboot und können dieses Boot nur empfehlen: unkompliziertes spätes Check-in war möglich, Betten zum Wohlfühlen und ruhige Nächte, Kücheneinrichtung für problemlose Frühstückszubereitung, geräumiges Bad und ein Gastgeber, der für Fragen jederzeit verfügbar und offen gewesen wäre. Tourenbroschüre und ÖV-Plänchen lagen bei der Ankunft bereits bereit. <br/>Einziger Wermutstropfen während unserer sommerlichen Woche war, dass von den vier Oberlichtfenster nur eines geöffnet werden konnte, da bei den andern die Halterung abgebrochen war, um die Spindel fürs Öffnen drehen zu können.<br/>"
28,295850826,7/24/2018,Nicky,Great accomodation beautiful spot and a pleasant walk into town
28,296987094,7/27/2018,Andrea,"This is a great boat house in a fantastic location. <br/>Check in and out is very easy with keys being left securely to make it possible at any hour.<br/>The boat is modern and stylish with all facilities that you will need. <br/>There really is something quite special about heading back to the accommodation after a busy day in the city, to sit on the deck with a glass of wine and watch all the day boats passing. It added so much to our experience of this great city. <br/>I would highly recommend this house boat. "
28,298985574,7/30/2018,Carole,Excellent week-end in Jupiter house boat. The description is in accordance with the announcement. The apartment is very clean  and the place in the center. Richard and Birgit were on holidays but Marijke and Richard's brother were at our service if we have any questions.   I'm going to give the adress to my friens.  It would be just air conditioning on summer.
28,304248115,8/9/2018,Eric,"Location, location, location!  It was so great to be on the water and right beside the Magere Brug - ""Skinny Bridge"".  The accommodations were modern, roomy and very clean.<br/><br/>It was quiet at night, and also a great spot to hang out on deck during the day as you watch the other boats go by. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a unique Dutch experience in Amsterdam, we would highly recommend it!   <br/><br/>The hosts were also very welcoming and helpful."
28,306192594,8/12/2018,Parag,A novel experience in a central location of a fabulous city.  
28,307894596,8/15/2018,Hilary,Very well located and fun.
28,308227713,8/16/2018,Waltraud,"war ein tolles Erlebnis eine Nacht auf dem Hausboot zu verbringen.  Das Boot war schön, gepflegt und gleich neben einer schönen Brücke. Kann ich nur empfehlen, wenn man einen netten Städtetrip machen möchte. Für Partypeople allerdings nicht geeignet, weil auch kleine Kinder im hinteren Teil des Boots wohnen und nebenan eine weitere Familie lebt, die Ruhe bevorzugt."
28,311791665,8/22/2018,Linda,"We had a great stay here.   After a delayed flight we arrived at night.  We were completely bowled over by the magical sight of our home for the next few days tucked right next to the illuminated bridge.  It really is very close. Sitting on the deck or in the living room you can watch the world go by and the bridge go up and down to let boats through  feeling extremely privileged to be sitting on the deck of such a phenomenally located and very stylish boat.  Yet  the boat manages to offer an oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city centre whilst also feeling really close to everywhere you want to visit.  The space is light and airy and to us was bigger than we would have expected on a houseboat.  The kitchen is small but was clean and had everything we needed (including the much appreciated Nespresso machine).   The bedrooms were cosy and comfortable without feeling cramped and we slept well.  I am a light sleeper though and was glad I had brought a sleep mask as there is no covering for the skylight in the main bedroom.  Richard and Birgit were great hosts.  In the run up to our trip they answered all of our questions very promptly and helpfully.   They also took our delay in their stride, despite the fact it meant we arrived very late.  The morning after our arrival  Richard came to say hello and during our stay they managed to strike a great balance between being welcoming and available if needed  whilst allowing guests their space and without being in any way intrusive.  Finally I would thoroughly recommend going on the BoatAmsterdam trip which is part of their business.   We joined the UNESCO route and looking around at all the other operators on the water, I definitely felt like we had lucked out.  "
28,314779177,8/27/2018,Donal Ray,"Richard was a most welcoming host. His houseboat is a spectacular home in simply the best location. Clean, convenient and quirky. Two thumbs up."
28,317518866,9/2/2018,Ken,Amazing location with walking distance to city centre and many other attractions. Friendly hosts and safe neighbourhood. Dont think we could have found a better place for our holiday.
28,319653971,9/7/2018,Chacho,Nice boat. Good location
28,322822787,9/14/2018,Celine,Incredible location and unique experience!
28,324483692,9/17/2018,Stéphanie,"Bateau magnifique très bien isolé et propre, très bonne literie,  situation géographie exceptionnel dans un quartier calme et proche de l'opéra, le centre est accessible à pied à environ 20 min., magasin alimentation à 2 min. et sympathiques cafés-restaurants proche. Nous y avons passé 3 jours inoubliables. Birgit et Richard qui vivent dans l'autre partie du bateau, nous ont bien reçu en nous fournissant toutes les bonnes recommandations. Nous recommandons  vivement ce logement athypique."
28,329105998,9/28/2018,Zachary,Richard’s boat offered spectacular people watching views and was such an incredible experience. Don’t miss out!
28,331270786,10/2/2018,Shawn,Richard and his family welcomed us when we first arrived.  Great communication too prior to arrival.  Boat was clean and everything as advertised.  We would return.  This is a shared space with owners who reside on other side.
28,332475919,10/5/2018,José Alejandro,"la ubicación es genial, el barco aporta una sensación genial a tu estadía, cuenta con todos los servicios y está a un lado del centro de Amstedam, sin duda volvería."
28,334070865,10/8/2018,Julie,Fabulous!
28,336360111,10/14/2018,Anke,"Besondere Unterkunft und tolle Erfahrung! Super Lage, kann ich nur weiterempfehlen!"
28,337956797,10/18/2018,Aaron,Amazing! We only stayed for 1 night but I will not hesitate to book this place the next time I am in AMS. Really unique and very central.
28,339295620,10/21/2018,Juergen,Lovely Place in Center of Amsterdam.
28,342123855,10/28/2018,Kate,This is a very stylish place to stay and gives you a true taste of life on the river in Amsterdam. Expect noise from the nearby bridge if sleeping upstairs but bedrooms offer no noise problems at all. Great facilities and lovely shower. Comfortable and well equipped it was cozy and very enjoyable. It has an amazing location and we loved watching the world go by. Having a great bar/cafe next to us was also perfect. Book it for a really unusual experience in comfort and style.
28,351012485,11/21/2018,Tommy,Great location. Fit three people comfortably. Very clean.
28,352483580,11/25/2018,Rachel,"Richard's houseboat is incredible. Once you figure out how to get in and out of the hatch, it's great. The location is amazing, the space is unique and comfortable and we slept great. There's nothing like waking up on the waters of Amsterdam."
28,354635504,12/2/2018,Erin,"Overall, a pleasant stay in a very unique home with a charming setting. We did not meet our hosts but they were very responsive leading up to our stay.<br/><br/>Very spacious considering it’s a boat. Perhaps this is a typical boat-quirk, but the bedrooms and shower room have open area to the upstairs living area, making for minimal privacy.<br/><br/>Definitely not the most child friendly accommodation (no railings at either stair, open areas, etc) but our almost 5- year old managed just fine."
28,357448475,12/10/2018,Daniel,Absolutely perfect.
28,363745517,12/29/2018,Erin,Richard’s place is AMAZING to say the least. It fit 3 people very comfortably. Perfect location and had everything we needed to have a successful trip. I couldn’t have asked for anything better!!
28,365331739,1/1/2019,Robert,"Alles war wie beschrieben. <br/>Die Räume und Sanitäranlagen sind modern, sehr sauber und gepflegt. <br/>Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und würden jederzeit wieder diese Unterkunft buchen. <br/>Richard ist ein sehr netter Vermieter und lebt ebenfalls auf dem Boot. <br/>Die Lage ist super, da nahezu alles zu Fuß erreichbar ist."
28,405441162,1/27/2019,Dimitri,The houseboat is a great experience! It feels warm and welcoming and the view is top notch. The area is nice too.
28,408749114,2/5/2019,Avi,"Very beautiful house, clean and in the best Location.<br/>take notice that there are neighbors attached to the boat and the set up is<br/>sensible to noise."
28,411060644,2/11/2019,Kelly,"The houseboat was very clean, and the kitchen had all the utensils we needed for the weekend.  <br/><br/>The location was perfect.  I have stayed in Amsterdam several times and would highly recommend this area.<br/><br/>I really did enjoy living on the boat, watching the world pass by on the Amstel River.  We even got to see the ‘Skinny Bridge’ open on the Monday to allow a couple of the larger boats through.  A unique experience!"
28,414325991,2/19/2019,Melanie,"What a great place to spend a few days exploring Amsterdam. Excellent central location with great facilities and surprisingly quiet at night. Overall a great place to stay with a bar on your doorstep, what more could you ask for."

28,422527758,3/11/2019,John,"Perfect relaxing base for visiting Amsterdam. Boat well equipped without being over fussy. Do take advantage of their boat tour, the guide was outstanding."
28,428530528,3/25/2019,Mandy,Staying on a canal boat in Amsterdam was brilliant.  Richard and Birgit’s boat is ideally located to see the city ... we had a very memorable family weekend.
28,432932416,4/5/2019,Emily,We were a group of four and had a great stay on the boat. The hosts were friendly and responsive and the boat is docked in a central and stunning location. We would recommend this space for anyone looking for an Amsterdam experience!
28,435360173,4/10/2019,Michael,"It was very easy to get to, right on the canal (literally). We always felt safe and it was a very comfortable space for the 3 of us. Richard also stopped by and gave us some recommendations for where to eat which was great as we had some amazing meals.<br/><br/>We would stay here again on our next visit, no doubt."
28,436958360,4/14/2019,Delor,"Très jolie péniche bien située, endroit calme, très propre et confortable. Pour nous le seul bémol était le jacuzzi où nous croyions pouvoir nous mettre toutes ensembles (nous étions 4 amies) et avons en fait découvert que c’était une baignoire avec des jets. Sinon Richard très sympa et très bon séjour original."
28,438619477,4/17/2019,Ulrika Och Joachim,Nice boat in a lovely place. Near everything and we had a wonderful view over the Skinny Bridge. Fun to live on a houseboat in this lovely and cosy city. <br/>Easy to check in and out.

28,445379518,4/29/2019,Joan,"We had a lovely three night stay on Richard & Brigits houseboat. The houseboat is beautiful and is located in a stunning position right beside the “Skinny Bridge”, the bridge is lit up at night & the views from the portholes & windows are amazing.  Great place to watch the world go by whilst having a morning coffee on deck. <br/><br/>Super location for walking out & we also went on the Boatsamsterdam canal tour which was perfect too. The tour was on a nice size boat, well run, & the pick up point was about a 5 or so minute walk along from the houseboat. <br/><br/>Amsterdam is beautiful, people are welcoming, I would definitely like to revisit & stay on this lovely houseboat again."
28,446833444,5/2/2019,Duncan,A wonderful location next to one of the iconic bridges of Amsterdam. The night lights from the “skinny bridge “ created a beautiful setting. Wish we could have stayed longer.

28,451140618,5/11/2019,Nadine,"Such fun to stay on a houseboat in Amsterdam! Exceptionally comfortable beds, good facilities and great location by the Skinny Bridge. Bear in mind when you stay on a boat you can hear everything and everyone from everywhere!"
28,457029229,5/23/2019,Gary,Great location. Fun way to spend time in Amsterdam
28,457439285,5/24/2019,John,"If you want a real Dutch experience, this is the place to come. Situated right by the ‘Skinny Bridge’, you get water level views of the bridge and across the Amstel, and room to lounge outside on the top if you want.  On a practical level, the boat was completely steady, not noisy and there were no water smells."
28,461198654,5/31/2019,Claire,"We loved our time on the boat - it’s a beautiful space, great location and made for a very memorable stay."
28,463358607,6/3/2019,Eimear,"Great location, and hosts very helpful"
28,464609939,6/6/2019,Michelle,"What a great experience! The location was perfect. It was an easy walk to all the museums with a 12yr old and 15yr old. The grocery was just down the street, and we ate several meals easily on the boat. My brother got a massage at Studio Infinity that he loved while we easily walked to Vondepark for a picnic lunch. (Get subs & salads & fruit from the local grocery Spar.) The beds were very comfortable and the boat quiet for sleeping. You can’t beat having the lights of the Skinny Bridge guide you home and twinkle through your windows!"
28,466569025,6/9/2019,Lizzie,"We had a lovely stay, great location, nice clean space with a great outside deck. Bathroom and bedrooms all spacious and well looked after. No hot tub although it says it on the listing. Check in was easy and instructions were clear. <br/><br/>We had some issues getting in contact with the host upon several occasions. We also tried to meet at the property as requested but no one turned up or answered us when we tried to get in contact, meaning we wasted time staying in to wait. We had an issue with lights in a bedroom that we also asked about but received no response - meaning one bedroom had no light. All of this was frustrating for us. <br/><br/>Great location and boat, just disappointed about the lack of communication."
28,468335689,6/12/2019,James,"Brilliant boat, would definitely recommend!"
28,471873947,6/18/2019,Debbie,We had a great time staying on the barge. It is in a really good location for getting around Amsterdam. There was lots of space and very comfortable beds. Richard answered questions and sorted any problems out quickly.
28,473689622,6/22/2019,Leonie,We loved staying on the houseboat it was spotlessly clean and it was situated in a great position and Richard was a great host
28,476851208,6/27/2019,Susan,Staying on the boat added to our trip to Amsterdam. Location is excellent and it was lovely to watch all the activity on the river and get a feel for the city. Perfect for a small family but definitely not for toddlers. The hosts live on the opposite end of the boat and were very pleasant and helpful.
28,480655926,7/3/2019,Viola,Amazing place with great views. Love the beanbag chairs on deck!
28,482304774,7/6/2019,April,Our family of 4 had plenty of room on this beautiful boat. We spent many hours sitting on the deck watching the boats on the river. Great location!
28,484570875,7/9/2019,Kendyl,What a magnificent place to stay. Very clean and comfortable accommodation. Wonderful views on the canal. A really unique experience which we all highly recommend.
28,486711094,7/13/2019,Brian,Great location and experience! Thank you!
28,489097005,7/16/2019,Eric,"Loved our stay at Richard and Birgit’s houseboat.  Great space in a great location.<br/><br/>Perfect space for a family of four or two couples.  Nice and bright common space, and a nice big, modern bathroom. <br/><br/>Central to everything and just a short walk to the center. Shopping and lots of restaurants nearby."
28,490676322,7/19/2019,Jennifer,"Gorgeous location, unique way to stay right in the center of things and on the water. Comfortable for 4 of us. We comfortably made some meals right in the kitchen too. Just a heads-up...There are a couple of bean bags out on the deck, but not really a spot for sitting out in chairs with a drink or meal.  Still, great spot to stay."
28,494929867,7/25/2019,Shay,"Outstanding. This is truly a unique experience. Great communication, clean, and perfect location. Not suggested for people with mobility issues because it is a boat and a bit tricky to get on and off."
28,500588322,8/2/2019,Erin-Louise,Fantastic location and a really novel way to spend a night in Amsterdam. <br/><br/>Super quiet at night!
28,506006427,8/10/2019,Helmut,We (2 adults and 2 youngsters) stayed 5 nights on the house boat and it was perfect.<br/>From that location you can reach all the interesting locations within walk distance.<br/>Although the ship is located near a bridge it was always quiet.
28,509379367,8/14/2019,Dawn,Wonderful location. <br/><br/>Beds were super comfortable and we all slept really well.<br/><br/>We had a lovely few days here. Would recommend.
28,509789638,8/15/2019,Jennifer,Amazing experience!
28,517022140,8/25/2019,Ruth,"Great  space, wonderful view of the Amstel and the bridge - cushions on the deck are a lovely place to relax and watch the world go by. Beds are comfortable, there are shops nearby for provisions and so many lovely places to see on the doorstep.  The hosts are welcoming and friendly but also respect your space. <br/>We so loved this boat - didn’t want to leave!"
28,523282397,9/3/2019,Amy,We enjoyed our 5 day stay on the boat. It is in a prime location and easy to get to. The interior was as expected and looks like the pictures. It was comfortable for our group of 3 women and well maintained. I would recommend this to others. <br/><br/>One thing to note is that there is an Amsterdam law limiting the number of people allowed to stay on the boat (4) and the hosts also have a restriction regarding the number of people allowed to be present on the boat at one time (4) - a challenge for us as we were traveling with several other people and would have loved to have them over for drinks or dinner.  <br/><br/>Not an issue for us - but would probably not be good for younger children (toddlers) as the stairway to the lower level does not have a railing to keep someone from stepping into that “hole”.
28,524488000,9/6/2019,Maximilian,Great Place and Good Communication!
28,526555513,9/9/2019,Tom,"Great place, location is unbelievable, the small pub next door is great, and a fab restaurant named 'Ku' is a short walk away. the accommodation is fantastic, entrance to the boat is via a sliding metal hatch, that requires a little confidence to operate, vs a traditional front door. but a fantastic experience in Amsterdam, would return!"
28,528553855,9/13/2019,Bernadette,Thanks for a wonderful stay. Such a beautiful boat with so much room. The children loved it
28,530674932,9/16/2019,Liz,"What a spot!! so fabulous to stay in this cool canal boat... right next to Magere Brug.  It wasn't too noisy at all.  The boat was so cool... great bedrooms and living spaces.  We had a problem with the water draining in the shower, but Richard was very quick to respond so hopefully it won't be an issue for anyone else.    <br/>The boat has a kitchen area, but we only used it for breakfast. It has a dishwasher (tablets supplied) which is great... and a Nespresso machine- which was fabulous in the mornings to sit outside on the beanbags and have a coffee!   <br/>There were quite a few spiderwebs around and perhaps a little bit of TLC (leaky tap) is needed."
28,532555786,9/20/2019,Brian,"Great location in central Amsterdam, next door to the Hermitage, the ""skinny bridge"" on the Amstel, a nice pub right across the road and a Spar supermarket about 100 metres away. Good tram and metro links are very close as well. We have been coming to Amsterdam for an annual weekend for many years and always wanted to try a houseboat. I would definitely recommend this one for anyone wishing to do the same."
28,534763242,9/23/2019,Ralph,"This boat is a fantastic space, really comfortable and sit in a fantastic location in Amsterdam. The place is well looked after, very clean and has amazing views of the Skinny Bridge. We loved sitting up on the decking in the mornings and in the evenings watching the world go by. I would highly recommend this houseboat for anyone looking for somewhere a little bit special to stay. Host Richard was fantastic. We would love to come back and stay again!"
28,536158893,9/26/2019,Jay,"Great location and nice hosts. Easy checkin/checkout. Overall, I recommend staying here. A word of caution is that sound carries very easily in this accommodation."
28,540278069,10/3/2019,Danielle,We had a great time staying on Richards boat. You really can’t beat the location or experience of being able to stay right on the canal like that. There are a couple things that need to be fixed but nothing that we couldn’t work around. The stairs can get very slippery when it’s raining so you have to be very careful when going up and down. Other than that we would definitely recommend staying on this boat.
28,544558572,10/10/2019,Virginia,We had the greatest time at Richard En Birgit’s house boat! I cannot say enough about how clean and conveniently located their place was! both Richard and Birgit were in constant communication and helped us with check-in and we’re always available for any questions. Their houseboat made our stay in Amsterdam that much better and it was the perfect end to our two week Europe trip with the girls!
28,551518756,10/20/2019,Kayleigh,We had a brilliant stay on this beautiful houseboat! It is central enough to be close enough to everything that you want but also far enough that you don’t hear all the hustle and bustle of the city. Would definitely stay again and recommend to people!
28,553533454,10/24/2019,Sandy,We stayed here for 4 nights loved it beautiful boat in a great location.<br/>Two couples worked well for us totally recommend.<br/>Not the place to be if you want to party late
28,554326710,10/26/2019,Timothy,We had an amazing time staying on the Amstel River. It was an experience we’ll never forget. Richard and Birgit were incredibly helpful with everything and the house boat was wonderful. We can’t wait to come back!
28,556311571,10/29/2019,Laurent Et Virginie,"Péniche très bien située pour visiter Amsterdam <br/>Calme et agréable <br/>Par contre le terme luxueux décrit dans l’annonce et qui justifie le prix  à perdu un peu de son éclat :<br/>Exemple :quelques gouttes d’eau s’échappent à cause de la condensation et donc le canapé est taché , des petites flaques à quelques endroits , congélateur pris en glace et lavabo des wc inutilisable .<br/>Dans la cuisine l’équipement est minimaliste <br/>Pour autant l’accueil était très cordial , la vue magnifique et le séjour super !!!"
28,557173563,10/31/2019,Kristen,The houseboat was a fantastic way to experience Amsterdam. The location was great and it was a pleasure to enjoy the views from the upstairs living area in the evenings. The space was larger than we had expected and the beds were very comfortable. The Jacuzzi was an added bonus. All round a great choice for our stay.
28,558631861,11/3/2019,Pascale,"Très belle expérience, emplacement de rêve."
28,564619098,11/16/2019,Sabina,One of the best places to stay in Amsterdam!
28,566002700,11/18/2019,Justine,"What a great place to stay! The location is fantastic, just by the Skinny Bridge and a short walk to pretty much everywhere you want to go. Richard was really helpful with the check in - we were lucky enough to have riverside views of St Nick arriving on his boat - what a treat. The boat itself is clean and spacious. I was surprised how warm it was too as we were there in the middle of November - very comfortable environment. The bed was super comfy - I was out like a light. Swans come and peek through the portholes. The shower is great. We had a great time and it was lovely to stay somewhere a little bit different. Thank you!"
28,569015333,11/25/2019,Crispin,"Houseboat Jupiter is a great base for a visit to Amsterdam. Most things can be found within a few blocks walk, including the metro and Centraal is only 2 stops away. The bakery down the street is fantastic. We were there as a family and it was perfect for the kids to have a quiet space to relax after the bustle of the city. We were there at the beginning of winter and it was nice and warm even when it froze outside. We didn’t want to leave. Thanks Richard."
28,572205475,12/2/2019,Ilona,Great location and neighbourhood!<br/>Wonderful houseboat! <br/>We will come back!
28,575126143,12/9/2019,Max,Lovely house boat well worth a stay
28,576739552,12/14/2019,Cylie,"Well, what an adventure! We didn't know what to expect and it was a heap of fun. Your right next the Skinny bridge so super close walk to everything. Challenge is that you are also super close to everything which includes noise. If you are a light sleeper, give this one a miss. <br/><br/>Boat is super spacious and with two teens, this really helped. However if you aren't great with stairs or uneven surfaces - this one is a nightmare. You have to come over top of another boat to get to, really tricky at night and with large suitcases. Made difficult by trying to be quiet and considerate of the neighbour. Also tricky to get these up and down the stairs. <br/><br/>Some of the lights and appliances were challenging to use and very basic (no microwave or toaster, only oven and dishwasher) but the coffee machine was very much appreciated. The heating was also amazing and appreciated after a freezing day out.  <br/><br/>Thank you to Richard for this space, made for a very memorable time in Amsterdam."
28,580130383,12/22/2019,Nancy,Excellent choice in Amsterdam!  Beautifully built houseboat with comfortable bedrooms and living area with every amenity.  Heated floors kept us cozy. Location was perfect on the Amstel - especially with Christmas decorations all around. Walking distance to everything. Great restaurants nearby on Utrechtstraat!
28,584532879,12/30/2019,Nicole,"Amazing location and a unique experience! I stayed here with my husband and mom. The living space is very comfortable with a dining table and sofas to relax at the end of a day of sightseeing. Below decks are two bedrooms with comfortable beds, a separate toilet (not a boat head), and a full bath with a rain shower and jacuzzi tub. The water is potable and there is plenty of hot water for showering and bathing. Our hosts graciously provided tea and coffee (Nespresso) as well. The location can’t be beat and we were delighted to find a Christmas tree on the deck when we arrived (we stayed during the week between Christmas and New Year). We’ve always wanted to stay on a houseboat and this one didn’t disappoint. Highly recommend this wonderful experience!"
28,586637563,1/2/2020,Fiona,A lovely stay on a lovely boat at a lovely location!
28,589614582,1/6/2020,Josie,Amazing place so beautiful and close to everything! Just a note for ladies there is only one mirror!
28,591001455,1/10/2020,Kirsten,"The Jupiter boat is certainly a novelty, accommodation-wise. The swans tapping on the porthole window was a highlight. The beds are comfortable. It is an interesting place to stay for a couple of nights."
28,604434618,2/11/2020,Dylan,"Not very private as have to share property with owners and they can look in windows at any time as there are no shades or curtains. No extra guest are aloud so would only recommend this for old people or quiet family of 4, was told it was the law that we couldn’t have anymore that four people on the boat at any time, funnily enough later that night we walked past a house boat on the very same street about 5 or 6 boats along and there was about a dozen or more people having a party and dancing away. We were only informed about this law a week before arrival once we had paid every penny."
28,608583153,2/21/2020,Lauren,"This air bnb was centrally located and easy to navigate the city. You have to be careful with the entry way, but otherwise it was a really unique experience to stay on the houseboat and we would highly recommend and would love to come back one day and stay here."
28,610797334,2/25/2020,Bethany,A unique experience with an excellent location!
28,613610226,3/2/2020,Will,"Staying on the houseboat was an interesting experience that we mainly enjoyed. The location was very good but I imagine we could have been just about anywhere within the canal area and have been just as happy. There were a few issues that made our stay less pleasant, including how the shower flooded every time we used it for more than 30 seconds, how challenging it was to physically get in and out of the boat (it feels like you are climbing into a bunker), and how the front gate was broken and took us a while to figure out the trick to open it. All in all, we wanted the experience of living in a houseboat and we can say we've done it."
28,634758578,7/5/2020,Diego,Tutto perfetto !!
28,643562620,7/28/2020,Laura,"The location of the houseboat is unbeatable – everything is in walking distance! However the walls are very very thin and no room is really ""closed"" because there are openings to other rooms. We were two couples which was a bit awkward, but if you're only 2 people the privacy should be alright. Also the owners were absolutely lovely and helpful!"
28,648772767,8/9/2020,Alexis,"Super séjour, belle surprise."
28,652694508,8/17/2020,Rita,"Fantastic location in the heart of Amsterdam, right on the Amstel River. Amazing and unique experience. You can even swim in the river!"
28,655381311,8/23/2020,Céline,"Our stay was really great! The boat was really clean and everything we could ask for was provided. The host was really nice and friendly, he gave use even a small tour of his safety boat next to the houseboat. Really nice and highly recommendable!"
28,3.89E+17,6/20/2021,Torsten,"Wundervolle Location, super Gastgeber. Immer wieder gerne."
43,56091567,12/8/2015,Tom,"Very nice room in a quiet area, very convenient for getting around in the city. Vicki was very welcoming and flexible when it came to in and out checking. I had a great stay in Ruben & Vikis place. "
43,56447359,12/13/2015,Daphné,"We had a perfect stay at Ruben & Viki. Lovely simple place with heartwarming vibes, thoughtful hosts, quiet neighborhood yet very easy to reach from the center (15' by tram).<br/><br/>"
43,57062617,12/21/2015,Burcu,"Viki and Ruben are lovely and easygoing persons. They wellcomed us and reccomended us their favorite places to see.<br/>The room is comfortable, clean and private. The neighbourhood is  close to city center and there are lovely cafes , bars, restaurants..  "
43,57927549,12/30/2015,Camille,"Very nice airbnb.<br/>Ruben & Viki are welcoming and make you feel like home. They prepared a list of restaurants, shops and places to visit. The apartment is lovely, well decorated and Tulli the cat is so funny.<br/>The apartment is close to the P+R parking (Bos en Lommer) but to get to the city center, you better like walking (30-45 min) or taking the tram."
43,75875722,5/23/2016,Siyi,"Lovely room, lovely people, lovely city. Living with you and Tuli enriches our trip. The tips given by the landlord are very detailed and useful. You are the artist of living. Strongly recommend!"
43,76972504,5/30/2016,Dinesh,"It was my first AirBnB experience and it could'nt have been better ! Ruben and Viki were absolutely wonderful and cheerful people who went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and nice. They had amazing insider tips for nice places to eat and see in and around Amsterdam. Follow their advice and you wont be disappointed :) The apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood and very accessible with trams / buses and bikes. The room was nicely furnished and comfortable. <br/><br/>Highly recommended ! We came in as guests and left as friends. Thanks and hope to see you guys back in Bergen."
43,484619878,7/9/2019,Sherry,Ruben and Vicki are great hosts. Would stay again for certain!
43,489680844,7/17/2019,Sam & Aleks,"Ruben met us right as scheduled and gave us a nice tutorial and walk-through, including offering some welcome treats. It was a good alternative to a hotel and had a functioning kitchen including the basic tools and a blender. The apartment is close to Rembrandtpark (great for walking!) and Vondelpark (great for biking, picnicking, and people watching!). It was a short bike ride to livelier neighborhoods and was on a quiet street. <br/><br/>We liked sitting out on the balcony, which faces a communal courtyard shared by the surrounding apartments. We did hear late-night conversations from the neighbors on the weekend. <br/><br/>There were great big windows in the living room and the bedroom had a door that opened to the balcony. But, no matter how long and tightly we closed the windows and doors, we had a problem managing the July mosquitoes in the bedroom throughout our stay, until we purchased a fan to run overnight. We also thought apartment could use some upkeep and cleaning, compared to what we’re used to. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a decent stay for a lower price than many other private listings, and offered autonomy."
72,48459329,9/26/2015,Zelda,What a great apartment! We booked last minute and the guys responded immediately to ensure everything was finalized and in order. The apartment is perfectly located with trams right at the doorstep. Beautifully decorated with everything you will need and more! <br/><br/>The apartment is very big for Amsterdam standards which makes it really comfortable. The hosts have really thought of everything a traveller may need including essential toiletries which we never even used. <br/><br/>A massive bonus was the projector tv and epic surround sound which was simply awesome for a movie night in when it rained. <br/><br/>We will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it!   
72,49157670,10/1/2015,Tal,We arrived to the apartment and a representative met us and gave us the keys.<br/>The apartment is beautiful and cozy and have everything you need for a perfect vacation.<br/>We had several soaps and toothpaste that the owner left for us we had towels and clean sheets.<br/>The area is amazing and had a very nice Coffeeshop near the apartment  and a huge market and a lot of stores.<br/>We definitely coming back again to that apartment 
72,50517545,10/12/2015,Joanne,"This was a wonderful apartment in the heart of De Pijp district.  it is light, clean and spacious and thanks to the double-glazing, quiet.  Check in was a breeze, I was welcomed in at the scheduled time and walked through the apartment.  Our stay was very comfortable with a great rain shower, sunny dining area in the morning overlooking the backyards and a huge sofa for relaxing on after a long day of sight-seeing.   De Pijp is a really cool area with lots of fantastic cafes and restaurants on the same street and neighbouring blocks.   Transport to from Centraal and Schipol are easy.   Recommended."
72,53916861,11/14/2015,Dave,The apartment was everything I expected and more. Very nice and very comfortable. The tram line goes right by the front door and in ten minutes you are in the heart of downtown. The Pijp district was lovely to be in with lots of shops and cafes and a huge park one block in one direction and the Amstel river in the other direction. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others. The wifi worked really well and allowed me great internet access.Thanks Abhishek!
72,54349421,11/18/2015,Kym,I had a lovely stay - the apartment was very spacious for one! Nice views and well appointed.<br/>It's in a great location with the tram right at the front door.
72,58095014,12/31/2015,Kalina,"We had a great time staying at this apartment! The listing description was accurate and the neighborhood was great. Check-in and check-out were easy, the apartment was lovely and located right on the tram line (we also rented bikes and mostly got around with those), and Abhishek was very prompt with all communications."
72,62942072,2/18/2016,Isaac,The Apartment was nice and very comfortable with all the modern appliances you need to feel at home. Its located very close to everywhere you need to get to and the transportation network is awesome as well. Just that the check out time needs to be reviewed and check in as well. Thanks Abhishek
72,63506127,2/23/2016,Sacha,"Great apartment, very comfortable stay while on business. Abhishek was a fantastic and attentive host, thank you very much. Will be staying again in future. "
72,67558164,3/30/2016,Romy,"I would definitely recommend this apartment as it is exactly what you expect from the pictures and we had a really great experience with the host who continued to check in with us throughout our stay.<br/><br/>Amazing neighbourhood which made it incredibly easy to get around Amsterdam either by walking or by tram (tram 4 is just across the street and takes you directly to Centraal in about 15 minutes). Walking distance to some great restaurants, bars, and cultural sights like Museumplein. Definitely recommend visiting the Van Gogh museum which we loved.<br/><br/>Overall great experience, which deserves 5 stars. We will definitely contact Abhishek next time we plan to travel to Amsterdam."
72,73450085,5/8/2016,Adrien,"A great apartment very close to the center and Museumplein. It was spacious, clean and well equipped. (Special mention for the kitchen).<br/><br/>We didn't use public transport (Amsterdam is a big village!) but there is a stop in front of the apartment. <br/><br/>Abhishek wasn't there in person but was very present and reactive by mail. We encountered no problem for check-in/out with his colleagues. <br/><br/>We recommend this apartment which made our trip that much more enjoyable. :)"
72,76167648,5/25/2016,Shira,"the apt was spacious and comfortable and utilized with a washing machine, kitchenware and a jacuzzi :)<br/>Location was excellent with public transportation right under our noses.<br/>Host was very helpful- always available to answer our questions and addressed special needs such as late check in."
72,79570647,6/13/2016,Giorgio,Bellissimo appartamento! Ottima posizione servita in maniera eccellente dal tram N. 4 sotto casa. <br/>Proprietari gentilissimi e disponibili 
72,81127750,6/21/2016,Yasser,"it was lovely place, clean, and good location.<br/><br/>Thanks Ashton, see you soon"
72,82294057,6/27/2016,Niclas,"Lägenheten ligger bra och relativt centralt med närhet till de största museerna och utomhusmarknaden Albert Cuyp (5 minuters promenad). Flera spårvagnslinjer stannar precis utanför och gör transporterna snabba och smidiga. I grannskapet finns bageri, frisör, skoaffär, kaféer, pubar, restauranger, mataffär (lite dyrare, motsvarande ungefär Urban deli i Sthlm) och mycket annat.<br/><br/>Vi upplevde inga störande grannar eller andra oljud i lägenheten, inte heller ute på innergården. Dock kanske en del kan uppleva spårvagnar och biltrafik som lite störande, då lägenheten ligger precis intill trafikerade gator, men det är inget värre än en lägenhet i motsvarande storstad. <br/><br/>Sängen var mjuk och bekväm, kuddarna stora och mjuka. Det är trevligt att sitta och äta frukost i köket och det är inget problem att jobba eller planera dagen därifrån under et par timmar, då stolarna är sköna och bordet stort. Köket har alla bekvämligheter man behöver om man vill laga mat. Det är trevligt med balkongen utanför köket men vi saknade dynor till stolarna. Vi utnyttjande endast vardagsrummet i liten utsträckning men soffan var stor och bekväm. Och det finns en bioduk med projektor för de som vill se på TV. <br/><br/>Värden och dennes team var mycket snabba att svara på frågor då man skrev meddelande, även vid udda tider på dygnet. De gav bra tips och var till hjälp med allt möjligt. De har en serviceminded attityd som vi uppskattade mycket. <br/><br/>Under vår vistelse råkade varmvattenberedaren slås ut. Efter två dagar var den återställd och vi kunde ta vår första dusch i varmvatten vilket var efterlängtat. Värden och hans team försökte fixa den så snabbt som möjligt. De kom och undersökte och gjorde allt de kunde för att snabbt få dit en rörmokare (att det dröjde berodde på att de flesta rörmokare var upptagna med efterdyningarna av relativt omfattad regnoväder), samtidigt som de återkopplade hela tiden. <br/><br/>Vi hade en anmärkning och det var städningen i badrummet. Framför allt golvet skulle behöva en rejäl rengöring. Vi upptäckte mindre trevliga fläckar på såväl toalettstolen som  på golvet nedanför. Vi påpekade detta men det skedde ingen åtgärd under vår vistelse.<br/>Den airconditionmaskin som finns i sovrummet slutade vi använda redan första dagen eftersom den gav ifrån sig lika mycket värme som den försökte kyla ner. Ett bättre alternativ vore att ha ett par vanliga fläktar i lägenheten då den känns kvav och instängd efter en hel dag på stan. Detta med brister på ventilationen upplevde vi som ett generellt problem i många butiker, pubar och restauranger och inte enbart i lägenheten.<br/><br/>Men sammanfattningsvis var detta en rymlig och trevlig lägenhet i ett bra läge. Dessutom var teamet runt omkring mycket bra och responsivt."
72,143276227,4/11/2017,Kalpana,It's a lovely home centrally located and very well maintained and stocked from amenities .  Fantastic stay and highly recommend to families and couples 
72,150596764,5/8/2017,Matthew,Great location!
72,155465510,5/28/2017,Henri,"Appartement très spacieux , nous avons passé un très agréable séjour .<br/>Le lit Est un peu trop mouilleur pour moi  ."
72,185676659,8/22/2017,Salman,Good two floor apartment. Front door key gives you problems and apartment is on second floor. Other than that its a great place in a great location with the pictures being mostly accurate. Projector is lovely!
67,62610608,2/15/2016,Genevieve,"I cannot say enough good things about Debbie (Host), the gorgeous flat and the location, but I'll give it a try :-)  <br/>Host (Debbie): Very sweet, considerate of our needs, our privacy and made herself readily available if we needed anything (in the flat, recommendations for restaurants, directions).  Debbie met us at the flat to let s in, show us around, how to use appliances (I shared with her that I would be cooking most of our meals) and to see if we had any questions about the area.  <br/>The flat:<br/>We loved the spacious, airiness that the whole place had; high ceilings, beautifully decorated, so much natural light, lovely view of the river, very functional kitchen with great appliances, conveniently located to grocery store, public transportation and walking distance to the RAI (we were exhibitors in an electronic show), nice neighbors and a fantastic cafe around the corner :-). <br/>Everything about the experience far exceeded our expectations; we will definitely stay here again when we come back to Amsterdam.  I highly, highly recommend this rental!  Thank you Debbie!!"
67,68773087,4/6/2016,Nickie,"The apartment is spacious and very well equipped. Debbie was excellent in communicating and extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything we needed during our stay. The apartment overlooks the Amstel river and it was pleasant gazing out the window at the daily life of river activity. Although there is a fairly main road between the apartment and the river, this was no problem and the bedroom at the rear was very quiet. The apartment also has a private rear balcony which would be great in hot weather.<br/>Although a little way out of the centre, nearby transport by tram into the canal ring is fast, frequent, reliable and enjoyable. Going further south from the apartment, a trip down the Amstel by bike is well worthwhile (and if you can make it as far as Ouderkirk aan der Amstel by the river track, well done you - the effort is definitely rewarded by coffee at the beautiful village bakery). I would also recommend a short walk over the bridge to Cafe Hesp to sit out by the river and enjoy a beer."
67,69312476,4/10/2016,Dorte,"Debbie war schon vor unserer Ankunft dauernd mit uns im Kontakt.

67,70717788,4/20/2016,Barbara,"This is a wonderful apartment overlooking the Amstel River south of city center with easy access to bus, tram, and metro.  Debbie was a wonderful host and made me feel welcome in her home.  She accommodated my timetable for early arrival and late departure.  She provided suggestions for places to eat.  She demonstrated all the appliances, which include a dishwasher and laundry machine.  Everything was just perfect and the location was ideal for getting a feel for life in Amsterdam.  Thank you, Debbie!!"
67,72467160,5/2/2016,Ioana,"Debbie is the best host I have met so far, very helpful and nice, and the apartament is much more beautiful in reality than in the photos. Very spacious, bright, it has a huge balcony, great furniture and decorations. The area is quiet and safe, closely located to the metro and tram stations, and the neighbors are very polite. The bedroom and kitchen are on the back of the building, therefore there isn't any noise; on the other side, the view from the living room is amazing, both during the day and the evening. I highly recommend this apartment, and I really hope to come back :)<br/>Once again, thank you, Debbie! I was lucky to be able to stay in your apartment and also to meet you :) "
67,73895303,5/11/2016,Amanda,"This is a beautiful apartment, spacious, comfortable and a real home from home. <br/>It's great to sit and watch the boats on the Amstel from the comfort of the sitting room!<br/>The bed is also very comfortable and the bedroom faces away from the street so it's quiet at night.<br/>The kitchen is well equipped for cooking.<br/>The local area is very nice, it's easy to find supermarkets & restaurants and near enough to the centre for easy access by tram or bicycle. <br/>From the first contact Debbie was very easy to communicate with, and is extremely friendly and helpful. A great hostess :-) <br/>We would definitely revommend Debbie's apartment for a stay in Amsterdam."
67,82035473,6/26/2016,Diane,"Debbie was a wonderful host always willing to help and make you feel as much comfortable as possible.<br/>I really enjoyed living in this very elegant appartment wich mixes authenticity and modernity. I was feeling like at home. It provides all the space and confort you need even for a long stay. It is clean, the equipment is full, everything is there (even the bycicle), you just need to unpack your suitcase. The balcony is large enough to enjoy a sunbath lying on the couch (because it was sunny).<br/>The location is perfect, 10min from the stop of the tram going to city center, 3min from the tram going to museums place, 10min from the metro station on the other side of the canal, 10min from food stores. <br/>And at last but not least, the View on the Amstel is a privilege !"
67,95409526,8/19/2016,Tom,"Debbie's apartment is a very stylish and comfortable place to stay! Great location too, only about 10-15 min cycle from the hussle and bussle of the city centre, but a 30 second walk from lively local cafes and restaurants. Debbie as a host was perfect - always contactable and was happy to help with any issues that arose (flat tyre was the only issue I experienced!).The amazing view of the Amstel river, straight through the living room's generous windows, is a priceless feature of the apartment! All in all, a fantastic place to live while I worked in Amsterdam over the summer and I would highly recommend! Thanks Debbie :)"

67,156365874,5/30/2017,Erika,"After a very long day of travel, Debbie's apartment was a welcome, restful retreat for my husband and I. The bed was very comfortable, the hot shower wonderful, and the views from the front window beautiful! Debbie was helpful and easy to communicate with, (even despite our phones'  international technical difficulties:)). "
67,158145122,6/5/2017,Moritz,We really enjoyed our stay at debbies' wonderful place. It is more spacious than we expected from the pictures and it's only a 5 minute bike ride to RAI.<br/>Debbie was super nice and welcoming and even let us use her bike for the time.<br/>Thanks for the great stay!

67,201837782,10/9/2017,Kari And Troy,Wow! What an amazing place this is. The space is stylish and super comfortable - much larger than I expected. The neighborhood is awesome. Lots of amenities yet quieter than most of Amsterdam. And Debbie! She is spectacular! She went above and beyond making sure we were comfortable and had everything we need to have a wonderful time in Amsterdam. Which we did. We’d be happy to stay here again!
67,204032712,10/16/2017,Federico,"We stayed at Debbie's apartment for 4 nights. It was clean, tidy, spacious, stylish and it provides all the comfort you need with a speechless view over the Amstel. The balcony was a cool place to chill after a long day around the city. We really liked the quite neighborhood, only 30 minutes by walk to the city center and we felt like home for the entire stay. <br/>Unfortunately we haven't had the chance to meet Debbie but she was extremely helpful and lovely with a lot of great suggestions on sights and restaurants. <br/>We definitely recommend Debbie and her apartment."
67,206420298,10/25/2017,Barbara,"Debbie was very welcoming when we arrived. She took time to show us how to use everything in the apartment. She also told us where to find grocery stores as well as suggestions for good restaurants. <br/>The neighborhood is quiet but the tram is easily accessible and you can connect to other sections of the city very quickly. It’s also a very walkable area. The view of the Amstel River was grand, and it is fun to watch all the activity on the river. The apartment is very spacious and the kitchen is well equipped for cooking. Due to an unfortunate knee injury, we did more cooking than was planned! All in all a lovely place to stay. Thank you Debbie."
67,250507739,4/5/2018,Redha,"Great place with a beautiful view of Amstel canal and next to Amstel Station and all public transportation you can think of (train, metro and tram) which puts you 20 minutes away of all touristic spots. Debbie is a very welcoming host who had excellent upfront communications and provided tons of information when we arrived."
67,252818266,4/12/2018,Joe,"We were enticed to choose Debbie's place because of the excellent reviews and view from the apartment.  Debbie began our visit with outstanding hospitality, she picked us up at the Amstel train station which was just a very short walk from her place.  The location is absolutely perfect to venture into the busy city and get away from it ( a 10 minute train ride away) at night.  The apartment is spacious, comfortable and has all the important amenities.  It has grocery stores just a few streets away as well as a few nice restaurants and bars to frequent, which we did.  Be sure to check our Weespers and Hesp just 5 minutes from the apartment.<br/>Debbie offered continuous assistance for things to do and the best travel options to the many different events.<br/>We have rented many times through other services but Debbie was by far the most helpful ""landlord"" we have ever had.<br/><br/>There was nothing better than having our morning tea looking at the rowers and boats on the Amstel out our front window."
67,264949843,5/15/2018,Taija,Debbie's spacy apartment and the view to Amstel river is very beautiful. We visited museum quarter and the city center easily by tram. Debbie is a friendly person.

67,267083929,5/21/2018,Jeff,"Debbie's place was awesome! The natural light in the big main window and relaxing view of the Amstel was perfect. The apartment has the feel and look of a lux suite which allows for a memorable stay. The kitchen is well equipped as is the apartment in general. We tried some local restaurants based on Debbie's recommendations and we were not disappointed. Short walk to the supermarkets as well. Debbie was wonderful as a host, she waited for us to arrive and greeted us with fresh OJ and an extensive intro into the area and anything we might need. I would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone!"

The apartment was clean, spacious and the river view from her living room was beautiful. The city centre was an easy walk, tram or bus ride away. After a full day of exploring the city, the apartment was a welcome refuge in a quiet neighbourhood where we could unwind, enjoy the view or relax with drinks on the balcony. Shops, restaurants, supermarkets, parks, walking/biking/running paths are all within a few minutes walk from Debbie's place. We highly recommend staying here."
67,489089698,7/16/2019,Mark,"This is a terrific apartment in a great location! My wife and I went there for 3 day getaway.    Debbie was the absolute perfect host and had everything covered for us including transfers, restaurants, museums and biking!  The apt. is just outside the very touristy center for those who want to avoid the dense crowds. It was an easy train trip to get there from Schipol.   The view of the Amstel River from the living room is spectacular both day and night and we loved having access to the private back balcony as well.  The apt. was very cozy, clean and secure.   We felt very at home there.     There are several very good local restaurants and bakeries in the neighborhood that are easy to walk or bike to.   We kind of fell in love with Amsterdam when we were there and would definitely stay here again."

Thank you!"
89,195461201,9/19/2017,Zac,"Amazing location (mass transit, 2 minutes from Foodhallen, near a canal, with a coffee shop, market and kick-boxing gym down the block) that could easily be a 5 star AirBnB with better linens, dresser/drawers in the master bedroom, and (for me) a smoother check-in process. (I was able to check in early -- which is wonderful after an all night intercontinental flight -- but the person doing the check in had never been in the unit before.) You will love the natural light and the balconies, the HUGE dining room / living area (almost empty it is so big) and the local flavor. Gemma was communicative and very helpful ahead of time and as good a host as she could be considering she was far away on holiday from before I arrived until after I left."
89,196923629,9/24/2017,Kyle,"A lovely neighborhood to wake up too! There are a couple of cafes on the corner that make for a great start to your day. The flat was clean, spacious and comfortable ."

87,62306195,2/13/2016,Vinciane,"Good situation of the apartment.<br/>Unfortunately, we have been disappointed for the following reasons :<br/>First of all, Janice is working (good for her), so we had to wait until she was back from her work to check-in (06:00 pm). Visiting Amsterdam with your luggage is not cool, right ? Fortunately, the guests of the night before were still in the apartment when we rang the bell at 02:00 pm, so we could still drop our luggage ... but Janice wasn't happy about that because we ""disturbed"" her previous guests !<br/>Secondly, we knew we would have to sleep in the sofa, it was ok for us. But, there was no sheet on the sofa, and no fitted sheet either !<br/>Thirdly, in the morning, of course no cup of tea or coffee, no breakfast eventhough Janice as probably tea, coffee, cereals for her own breakfast because she's living there. It would have been appreciable ...<br/>And finally, when taking a shower, the water was cold !<br/>I don't recommend that place at all."
87,62853613,2/17/2016,Aude,The communication with janice was easy and worked well. The apartment is well situated but very cold ;-) also it seems that it's renovating but it was nice and has a wunderful view on the typical amsterdam canal.
87,63488127,2/23/2016,Natalia,Janice is a friendly hostess. The apartment is in a quiet area and it's well connected. The sofa bed is comfortable and I slept very well. I recommend it!
87,63742203,2/26/2016,Danielle,Janice was very welcoming and accommodating for us! We got in late on Thursday night which was no trouble and she let us store our bags on Friday while we toured around Amsterdam! Her place is very central and easy to get to from centraal station by tram! 
87,64672802,3/6/2016,Sammie,"Janice was a lovely host, very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Her place looks exactly like the photos and the location is amazing for exploring the city and you get the feeling of living like a local.

87,66910307,3/25/2016,Meeka,"Janice was not able to help us check in because she has work and need to be away from amsterdam. However, she provide very detail information for us to get the key and information about the room. She also reply instantly whenever we have questions. The room is exactly like the picture. very comfortable sofa bed and clean shower room. the location is absolutely perfect, easily access to city by foot. Definitely recommend this place :)"
87,68435885,4/5/2016,Rachal,Janice's place was perfect for the one night I was staying in Amsterdam. Great location and Janice was very friendly and helpful! 
87,68730606,4/6/2016,Aurélie,"Super séjour à Amsterdam. Hôte très agréable et très conviviale. Appartement très agréable aussi, bien placé. Je vous conseille Janice comme hôte pour votre séjour à Amsterdam"
87,69810893,4/13/2016,Adrian,"Hemos estado poco tiempo, pero estuvimos muy bien, Janeez nos ha ayudado mucho con el tema del trasporte, El barrio esta muy bien, con accesibilidad por transporte publico como de a pie. La información brindada es correcta"
87,70233042,4/17/2016,Miriam,"Janeez was a really nice host. The housis in a very good area centered in Amsterdam, so it is possible to go downtown by walk. The sofa is confortable and the room really big!"
87,70644473,4/19/2016,Amine,"Communication with Janice prior to my arrival was perfect. Besides, she was very helpful in searching with me for a cheap car parking place not far from her apartment. Her flat is exactly as shown in the photos, and it is well kept. I highly recommend her as a host."
87,70923831,4/22/2016,Dries,"Nice apartment with a lovely view, great location! Friendly host. I really recommend this place! "
87,72028662,4/30/2016,Melissa,"Really nice hostess! Thank you for everything Janeez! Good place to stay, close to the Melkweg venue."
87,72261106,5/1/2016,Irina,"We stayed in the appartment for 1 night: good location, perfect view, very nice and helpful host. We strongly recommend this appartment for your stay in Amsterdam! "
87,72467185,5/2/2016,Bianca,Very friendly & uncomplicated. Good location. Definitely a good place to stay.
87,72609908,5/3/2016,Romain,Janeez was a perfect host. The apartment is nice and very quiet. My two days in Amsterdam was very good. Thanks again :)
87,72892441,5/5/2016,Sangar,Janeez is a very friendly and cheerful host. I learnt a lot of additional tips about Amsterdam that i otherwise would not have. The place is comfortable and just a 8min ride away from the train station and the city center. Its also within the Jordaan district and a stones throw from the nine streets. Thank you for hosting me :D
87,73523253,5/8/2016,Freya & Thomas,"Janeez ist sehr nett. Es hat uns bei ihr gut gefallen. Man darf nicht den Anspruch haben, komplett, privat für sich dort zu leben. Schließlich lebt man in ihrem Wohnzimmer. Wir (Pärchen) waren ein verlängertes Wochenende bei ihr und haben Amsterdam besichtigt. Die Lage ist super, die Küche darf mit benutzt werden - und auch auf dem Schlafsofa kann man gut schlafen. Es ist alles fußläufig zu erreichen. "
87,74071343,5/12/2016,Erin,"Janeez is very welcoming, friendly and hospitable. We loved chatting with her! Her details on how to get to the apartment were useful and location is great! Very close to the city centre and is situated in the picturesque Jordaan area. The apartment looks out onto one of the canals too. The apartment is cozy, well equipped and is shared with Janeez. If you like a dark room to sleep in it might be useful to use a night mask as there is a bit of street light that comes through the curtain edges. Overall a lovely stay! Thank you Janeez!"
87,75269331,5/20/2016,Amalenalee,Janeez was the sweetest host. She communicated with us but also gave us space. She always made us feel welcomed! The location of this flat is amazing! We didn't have to take public transportation once to do all of the touristy spots in Amsterdam. The city is so walkable! I highly recommend staying here if you don't mind sleeping in a living room. The sofa bed is very comfortable! The view and location is perfect! 
87,75939686,5/23/2016,Bruno,"Janeez nos recibió muy bien, fue muy amable y nos ayudó mucho con unos problemas que tuvimos en el viaje. <br/>El departamento es muy cómodo y tiene vistas a un canal de amsterdam. La ubicación esta bien, y la limpieza es excelente. <br/>Gracias! Lo recomiendo para cada visita a amsterdam."
87,77540956,6/1/2016,Özlem,"It was a beautiful apartment with a canal view. A real Amsterdam experience! You can sleep or wake up with this view.<br/>Good location. <br/>Janeez was also very helpful. Though the bed is a sofa bed, it was also quite comfortable -except for the pillows. I would prefer normal pillows instead of sleeping on the sofa's pillows! :(<br/>The only thing I didn't like was that the hall we slept in didn't have a door. I would prefer more privacy. "
87,77927031,6/4/2016,Ahmed Amine,Janeez was very friendly and helpful. We had to check-in a little bit late because she had to finish work first. The apartment is well located and as described.
87,78408045,6/6/2016,Camille,Such a great neighborhood and view :) Thanks for the warm welcome!
87,78678043,6/8/2016,Evan,From the start Janeez was helpful and accommodating! Always quick to reply and providing helpful tips before and during our stay. The apartment was clean and comfortable and Janeez offered us the perfect amount of privacy! The area felt safe and everything was within walking distance. Janeez gave us helpful tips for attractions to see and was wonderful to talk with. I would highly recommend staying here not only for the perfect location but also a gracious host! 
87,79650225,6/13/2016,Maddie,"Janeez made our stay in Amsterdam that much more awesome. Her apartment is super close to everything in the city and check-in/check-out was a breeze. She provided us with a great sofa bed to sleep on, towels and some tips about Amsterdam life. Definitely try and stay with her if you're looking for a host who will provide you with information and a nice, quiet place to stay."
87,80705692,6/19/2016,Soyul (Bia),"Janeez is super friendly, easy to connect with, welcoming and she's an avid traveller herself! I hadn't fully planned my trip until I got there; so she was very helpful in telling me all the interesting things to do and spots to go to. Felt right at home and felt as if she had already been a close friend of mine. I love that her place isn't too far away from the Amsterdam Centraal : Only had to walk for about 20-30min. It's near a cute hip neighborhood called Jordaan, which is also a plus... "
87,81444699,6/23/2016,Eleanor,We really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam. Basic but all we needed and quite convenient to town. The host was very welcoming 
87,81971531,6/26/2016,Jaclyn,Exactly what we needed for a few days! Thank you!
87,83402601,7/2/2016,John,Janeez was very nice when showing us her place. It was very comfortable and seemed to be in a great location. If I ever go back to Amsterdam I would definitely look into staying here again.
87,84264840,7/6/2016,Laura,Jannez was a perfect host!! The apartament is beutiful with a great canal view and perfect location. The sofa bed is very comfortable. Thank you Jannez!!! 
87,84899938,7/9/2016,Simin,"Janeez's place is very warm and cozy. The view from the living room is great. The sofa bed is comfortable, but it may be a bit cold if it's not summer. Janeez is a perfect host, giving us useful advices and enough privacy. Overall, it's a great place to stay for a few days in Amsterdam."
87,87630860,7/21/2016,Edith,"Janeez was really nice and made us feel immediately welcome, her place is clean and our bed was even made for us! Location is good and so close to Anne Frank's house, would recommend."
87,146607377,4/23/2017,Guyue,a cute studio perfect for 1 or 2 person. There is a great view of canal and very close to the tram station. We can easily take the airport express there. Besides Janezz is a very nice girl who introduce us many things about the house and how to enjoy Amsterdam in the trip.
87,150506873,5/8/2017,Antoine,Nice flat in a nice spot of Amsterdam.
87,187126149,8/26/2017,Mercedes,"Janeez was a great hostess. We met her the first night and she was able to answer all of our questions. She is located right by Anne Frank's house and is walking distance from everywhere. Don't worry about the sofa bed being uncomfortable, it was super comfortable. I would definitely come back!"
19,71469210,4/25/2016,Siti,"The apartment is great and like in the pictures!! It is really modern kind of style which is really different. The only weird thing is the toilet is separated from the shower and is situated at the front after the door, but it's all good. Most important is that the house is  really clean and comfortable. It is very near to the tram and bus as well, so it was very easy to go to the center and back. There's also a halal fried chicken restaurant (something like KFC) in a walking distant so that was pretty awesome if you need to find halal food! It's just unfortunate that we didn't meet Corey in person. "
19,71768534,4/28/2016,Taylor,"Corey's place was perfect! Perfectly situated near a tram and bus stop, the apartment is very spacious and clean. Lovely amenities and Corey provided a lot of information on the city. Would definitely return if we were ever back in Amsterdam."
19,151895231,5/14/2017,Mario,everything ok
19,153591652,5/21/2017,Omar,Très beau apparemment accueil chaleureux et bien renseigné à recommander merci
19,158002174,6/5/2017,Charlotte,"When we booked it we didn't realise it was a bit far out from the centre of Amsterdam. However, it was a 20min bus ride so it wasn't too bad. The apartment it self was very spacious. One issue I had was that there was a bad odour throughout the apartment and was very off putting. We had to keep the balcony door open just to get rid of the smell. Also when we <br/>arrived the bed was not made and we was asked if we didn't mind making the beds ourselves. In the end he helped us make the beds. I wouldn't stay here again but I have high hopes that my comments will be looked into. <br/><br/>"
19,180868311,8/11/2017,Alexandre,"Corey was a great host. The flat was clean, well located. Corey was always present if needed ! We recommend it ! :)"
19,182346360,8/14/2017,Zen,"Corey's place is very bright, clean and spacious. It's a little out of the way but once you get a bike it's worth the journey."
19,186708554,8/25/2017,Jean,Good location - next to train station.
19,217765596,12/10/2017,Tom,"Great place to base yourself out of on a trip to Amsterdam. Not far from the centre, spacious and comfortable. You’ll love it here :)"
19,232156867,2/4/2018,Omar,Easy to reach and good to chill in apartment.
19,234581247,2/13/2018,Arnaud,"Logement super et très bien entretenue, il s'agit d'un appartement pratique et confortable. Je vous le recommande si vous vous voulez passer un séjour à Amsterdam !"
19,236031062,2/18/2018,Andréa,host very welcoming! Apartment ideally located next to the metro.<br/>Corey gives great directions to things to see in Amsterdam. I recommend this apartment!
19,240129450,3/4/2018,Guillaume,Very nice and helpful host. Beautiful apartment very bright close to public transport. Great weekend in Amsterdam thank you Corey.
19,242178628,3/11/2018,David,Corey was awesome throughout the whole experience!
19,244112005,3/18/2018,Camilo,Corey's home is clean and warm (we were there for an especially cold weekend) and well located for quick access to public transportation across the city. Corey was attentive and highly responsive in his communications.
19,246413206,3/25/2018,Guillaume,"Super hote, chaleureux !"
19,251609724,4/8/2018,Sydney,Very nice
19,253385824,4/14/2018,Caleb,"Corey's was a comfortable place to call home for two nights in Amsterdam. We were traveling with a one-year-old, and we found it fairly easy to childproof and a low-stress stay. We came about three days too early to catch the magnolia trees blooming in the courtyard! It's a fairly short tram ride into the center, especially if you want to get into Jordaan to explore. Plus there is good Indonesian food nearby. Corey was attentive and offered us a free night at the end, which was a really sweet gesture, even if our travel plans prevented us from taking it. It is worth noting that the apartment was clean, but it does smell a bit like smoke, which might bother folks who are sensitive to that kind of thing."
19,256068440,4/22/2018,Ryan,"Definetly a nice apartment. I felt like it was a little over priced but thats okay. It is right next to the metro station and tram lines. Private balcony. Awkward shower and toilet setup, but other than that, the house was nice. It came with a TV and speakers with an Aux cord. HDMI cord for laptop was bad and hardly worked. But hopefully you are exploring Amsterdam and not being lazy watching TV :)"
19,258510028,4/29/2018,Adam,"Corey’s place is pretty nice, a little slick less is more style to it. Some really nice natural light and quiet area. We didn’t meet Corey but he’s communication was good and the lady that left us in was very helpful. The transport system to bring you in to the centre has a bus, tram and metro so you won’t  be stuck for getting to town and back in 10 mins or less."
19,263110085,5/11/2018,Shinghin,Wifi connection is good. Clean. Next to train station.
19,264098933,5/13/2018,Jackie,Corey’s apartment was lovely. Perfect for a weekend break for two. The place was lovely and clean and extremely spacious. <br/><br/>Yes it’s a bit of a way from the centre. But if you hire bikes it’s very easily accessible. Metro and buses are right on your doorstep and it’s all very easy to navigate. <br/><br/>I would say that the area is ‘up and coming’ but we felt quite safe walking back in the evenings and it was generally quite quiet. Certainly quieter than it would have been anywhere near the centre. <br/><br/>All in all it was just right and we wouldn’t hesitate to book to stay here again. Thank you Corey :)
19,269292162,5/27/2018,Elise,"Very spacious apartment, next to public transports. Good communication. We loved our stay here :)"
19,278043278,6/17/2018,Amy,The apartment was amazingly stylish and spacious. We had a lovely weekend in the city. Corey was very helpful and communication was excellent. Would definitely visit again. 
19,280968280,6/24/2018,Ville,Everything was excellent. Would come again.
19,302821640,8/6/2018,Patrick,"Corey's place is conveniently located next to public transit (right outside the front door). It took us only about 20 minutes on the tram or metro to get to central station. The apartment is very spacious, bright and clean. However, the smell of cigarette smoke was very overpowering and bothered us quite a bit throughout our stay. This is the only reason for star deductions, as the place was clean and Corey was extremely nice and responsive."
19,323864862,9/16/2018,Vsevolod,Corey is amazing host. I've enjoyed our conversation a lot.<br/>the apartment is clean and very close to public transport - you will have 0 problems getting to the center. <br/><br/>Now it's the place to stay for me in Amsterdam.
19,339293576,10/21/2018,Marc-André,We had a wonderful stay at Corey’s place. Pictures are 100% real.<br/>There is everything we need and it’s located 20min away from Amsterdam Central Station by bus. And all public transports are really close by the flat! <br/><br/>We had great and easy communication with Corey. He is really nice and helpful. He gave us all information we needed.<br/><br/>We will definitely come back to Corey’s place and totally recommend it!
19,437886525,4/15/2019,Claire,"Emplacement à côté du métro, dans un quartier calme. Trajet direct pour waterlooplein. Appartement spacieux et très propre. Hôte agréable et serviable. Super séjour !"
19,443973529,4/27/2019,Anthony,Great place right by public transport. Takes you right into the heart of Amsterdam. It is also very close to the highway if you rent a car. Place is clean and has what you need. Corey was helpful and responded quickly. Recommend this place for anyone visiting Amsterdam.
19,451231897,5/11/2019,Alexandru,Great apartment.
19,461197345,5/31/2019,Vince,There is truly nothing not to like in this place.  It is among the best Airbnb's that we have stayed in (and that's quite a few).  Corey is an excellent host; the apartment is equipped with everything that one could need; and the local transportation is excellent.  We will certainly go back next time we are in Amsterdam.
