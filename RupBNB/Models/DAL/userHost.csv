I am Henriette living in Amsterdam since 1983 on several places.
I was born in Eindhoven in the South of Holland and studied at the University of Nijmegen and Amsterdam political science and film-science.
Many years I worked as a film/video/performance programmer in theatres. 
Since 1990 I am working as a TV journalist and now for many years for a current affairs program. 
I love my work. And I really enjoy going to arthouse movies experimental cinema music and dance.  
Traveling and seeing other cultures makes me happy as well as meeting my family eating with friends and biking with my partner.
I already have a B&B since 1999.  I like it so much : it enriches my life meeting all kinds of different people.

In 2014 I bought my own house and that's a joy. Because I are not at home all the time I thought about sharing my house with you the travellers. My crib is close to the city centre but in a quiet and green environment. My style of living is quite simple not too much clutter around the house. Just the things you need and some inspiring/funny decorations and lovely plants.
My hobbies: friends family music enjoying food and drinks to enjoy the small things. And of course travelling. I have been to several parts of the world also for longer periods of time. 
I speak English some Spanish Dutch and some German.
I would love to meet new people from around the world so be my guest!
